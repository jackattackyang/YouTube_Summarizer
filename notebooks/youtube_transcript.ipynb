      "is kinda like a indicative\n",
      "522.18s - that like even though the overall problem\n",
      "523.373s - is like very simple, the kind\n",
      "of corresponding difficulty\n",
      "526.32s - just goes into like making\n",
      "your like models hit\n",
      "530.07s - like this, like very high perf barrier.\n",
      "534.75s - Another ind of a interesting observation\n",
      "537.48s - in like machine learning is that,\n",
      "539.76s - that has kind of exacerbated this a bit.\n",
      "541.95s - Is that the field has\n",
      "consolidated significantly\n",
      "544.05s - over the last five to 10 years.\n",
      "546.57s - So one of them is that like, you know,\n",
      "548.25s - like maybe 10 years ago you had\n",
      "like a lot more architecture\n",
      "551.04s - is a lot more variance\n",
      "and like different things\n",
      "552.69s - that people were trying.\n",
      "554.07s - But nowadays people really\n",
      "just like transformers are like\n",
      "557.61s - the dominant architecture for everything.\n",
      "558.96s - Like you have transformers for\n",
      "vision, you have transformers\n",
      "560.94s - for language, you have\n",
      "transformers for like, you know,\n",
      "563.25s - audio, it's kind of like all transformers.\n",
      "566.46s - And the other way like\n",
      "things have kind of changed\n",
      "568.47s - is that instead of like, you\n",
      "know, many different people\n",
      "571.5s - training SOTA models.\n",
      "572.88s - You oftentimes just have a few companies\n",
      "574.89s - that are training SOTA models.\n",
      "576.42s - And so we've kind of gone\n",
      "from a bit of like a monopoly\n",
      "578.82s - where like, you know,\n",
      "previously there was this like,\n",
      "581.271s - you know, one person providing the infra\n",
      "582.57s - and like many people using the infra,\n",
      "584.7s - to in some ways it feels a\n",

      "588.06s - where you have like many\n",

      "597.015s - And so as a kind of\n",
      "result, I think that like\n",
      "600.3s - there's kind of two\n",
      "general ways to think about\n",
      "602.46s - like getting performance\n",
      "from like your systems.\n",
      "605.73s - And so one of the ways\n",
      "generally is basically\n",
      "607.95s - like optimizations is\n",
      "like you have a compiler,\n",
      "609.9s - you like make the\n",
      "compiler faster, you know,\n",
      "612.57s - you improve like the performance\n",
      "613.86s - of everybody using your compiler.\n",
      "616.692s - and so the other way though\n",
      "617.525s - is kind of like programming models.\n",
      "619.89s - And so like this is kind of analogous\n",
      "621.27s - as opposed to like a\n",
      "system whose responsibility\n",
      "623.97s - is to like chop down a tree\n",
      "625.56s - and then you know, you're\n",
      "just like optimizing\n",
      "627.09s - how fast you can chop down the tree.\n",
      "628.86s - And the other alternative is\n",
      "like you're providing tools\n",
      "631.17s - for people to cut down\n",
      "the trees themselves.\n",
      "635.13s - And so to kind of like talk a little bit\n",
      "636.72s - about programming models, I\n",
      "think it's like illustrative\n",
      "640.44s - to kind of talk about\n",
      "how like ML frameworks\n",
      "642.42s - have kind of evolved in\n",
      "terms of what program model\n",
      "644.82s - they've exposed to users.\n",
      "647.04s - So originally like I think like 2010,\n",
      "651.23s - like 2011, 2012, the\n",
      "first like ML framework\n",
      "654.15s - that kind of got a lot of\n",
      "popularity was this framework\n",
      "656.19s - called Caffe.\n",
      "657.33s - And the way you like express\n",
      "neural networks in Caffe\n",
      "659.46s - is like a very declarative nature.\n",
      "662.04s - And by that I mean you like\n",
      "edited a protobuf file I think.\n",
      "665.88s - Where like the protobuf like\n",
      "specified all the things\n",
      "668.04s - you needed like care\n",
      "about your neural network.\n",
      "671.25s - And so as you can imagine, you know,\n",
      "672.42s - programming protobufs is\n",
      "like not very fun, you know,\n",
      "674.82s - there's a lot of things\n",
      "you might want to do\n",
      "677.011s - that you can't do in protobufs.\n",
      "678.36s - and so a like natural\n",
      "net thing that people did\n",
      "681.3s - was kind of these kind of\n",
      "graph builder type APIs.\n",
      "684.15s - And so this is kind of,\n",
      "you know, how TensorFlow 1\n",
      "686.19s - kinda of look like where the\n",
      "idea is that oh, you know,\n",
      "688.59s - like programming like, you\n",
      "know, programming protobufs\n",
      "691.26s - or like no human should need\n",
      "to write protobufs by hand.\n",
      "694.38s - And so ideally, you know,\n",
      "695.73s - you should just like\n",
      "write like a DSL of sorts\n",
      "698.61s - that allows you to generate the protobufs\n",
      "700.74s - like from this DSL.\n",
      "703.47s - However, like even this\n",
      "DSL still kind of has\n",
      "706.02s - like a lot of confusion in it.\n",
      "708.18s - Like it is not super clear\n",
      "that like given this DSL\n",
      "710.31s - like how code actually\n",
      "executes on your GPU.\n",
      "714.06s - And so kind of finally\n",
      "like around 2016 or 2017,\n",
      "717.78s - PyTorch started to become\n",
      "like really successful.\n",
      "720.06s - And kind of the like the feature\n",
      "722.7s - that like was most emblematic\n",
      "of PyTorch was basically\n",
      "726.33s - what was called imperative\n",
      "or eager execution.\n",
      "728.73s - And so what this means is that like,\n",
      "733.86s - or like, yeah, so PyTorch\n",
      "you know, was very successful\n",
      "736.29s - and I think it's like worth talking about\n",
      "737.46s - like why eager execution\n",
      "was so successful.\n",
      "740.31s - And I think that the main\n",
      "reason it was successful,\n",
      "742.05s - it just comes down to like\n",
      "what the programming model\n",
      "744.24s - of the execution looked like.\n",
      "745.6s - Where in a imperative\n",
      "slash like eager execution\n",
      "748.35s - is basically like, you\n",
      "know, you call a function,\n",
      "750.96s - the GPU runs a function\n",
      "752.73s - and then the function finishes\n",
      "and you know, that's it.\n",
      "755.656s - Like, you know, like that's\n",
      "basically all you do.\n",
      "757.35s - you call like torch.matmul\n",
      "and this is basically\n",
      "759.54s - the sequence of operations\n",
      "that happens but you know,\n",
      "762.51s - with kind of like a\n",
      "graph mode type approach\n",
      "765.06s - or you know, where kind\n",
      "of this pilot interjects.\n",
      "767.4s - You first like define the function,\n",
      "769.29s - the function gets converted\n",
      "into some like intermediate IR,\n",
      "772.552s - you know, a bunch of who knows\n",
      "what happens to your function\n",
      "775.86s - and then eventually like the\n",
      "function eventually executes\n",
      "778.53s - on the GPU.\n",
      "780.39s - And like the top one\n",
      "was like a very simple\n",
      "783.6s - execution model for people to understand.\n",
      "786.81s - And I think another thing\n",
      "that's kind of interesting\n",
      "788.58s - to notice about this is\n",
      "that this kind of also just,\n",
      "791.28s - like the top half also kind of describes\n",
      "793.83s - how Python executes.\n",
      "796.56s - And I think this is kind of\n",
      "a pretty illustrative to me\n",
      "798.81s - of like why Python has been so successful\n",
      "801.11s - in machine learning.\n",
      "802.62s - It's basically that like,\n",
      "like a funny statement\n",
      "806.31s - that you can make about Python\n",
      "is that like if you tried\n",
      "808.95s - to like train a model\n",
      "today, like you know,\n",
      "812.25s - I gave you like a day\n",
      "to like train a model,\n",
      "814.68s - it would run faster if\n",
      "you ran it in Python\n",
      "816.51s - compared to doing in C++.\n",
      "818.67s - And you might argue that this\n",
      "is like a unfair comparison.\n",
      "822.78s - Because you know, like you\n",
      "know all the infra like,\n",
      "824.947s - you know, all the\n",
      "frameworks that people built\n",
      "825.9s - are in Python.\n",
      "827.25s - But I think the reason why so many\n",
      "828.78s - of these frameworks have\n",
      "been built in Python\n",
      "830.67s - is that Python is like an exceedingly like\n",
      "833.31s - a simple language.\n",
      "834.63s - And so it's also like\n",
      "a very global language.\n",
      "837.78s - And what I mean by like global\n",
      "is that like it's very easy\n",
      "840.39s - for people to build\n",
      "their own infrastructure\n",
      "842.04s - on top of Python without\n",
      "really needing to fight\n",
      "844.68s - with like anything the\n",
      "Python language does\n",
      "846.93s - because the Python language\n",
      "itself does basically nothing.\n",
      "851.175s - Like it, you know, it doesn't\n",
      "do any optimizations for you.\n",
      "853.38s - It just like, you know, takes\n",
      "your function and runs it.\n",
      "856.98s - And so I think that PyTorch\n",
      "basically historically\n",
      "859.83s - is at like a very similar\n",
      "point in the design space.\n",
      "862.86s - Where PyTorch is like execution\n",
      "model is like so very simple\n",
      "867.93s - and although this like\n",
      "doesn't really give you a lot\n",
      "870.3s - in terms of like, it\n",
      "doesn't like automatically\n",
      "871.95s - do a lot of things for you, it\n",
      "does mean that it's very easy\n",
      "874.71s - for people to like build\n",
      "their own infrastructure\n",
      "878.37s - and frameworks on top of PyTorch.\n",
      "886.523s - I think another important\n",
      "detail to realize\n",
      "890.16s - especially about like PyTorch\n",
      "when it first came out.\n",
      "892.62s - Is that like this kind\n",
      "of unoptimized execution\n",
      "895.74s - didn't actually even sacrifice\n",
      "any performance at all.\n",
      "899.07s - Like, you know when\n",
      "people kind of benchmarked\n",
      "900.45s - PyTorch versus like, you\n",
      "know, TensorFlow at Cafe,\n",
      "903.03s - PyTorch oftentimes wasn't even\n",
      "slower than those frameworks.\n",
      "907.08s - And I think there's like a\n",
      "two main reasons for this.\n",
      "909.45s - So the first reason is\n",
      "that back in the day,\n",
      "911.85s - like you know about like\n",
      "90% plus of your time\n",
      "914.04s - was spent in matmuls.\n",
      "915.3s - And so there's basically nothing\n",
      "else you need to optimize.\n",
      "917.7s - And so matmuls here are\n",
      "like matrix implications\n",
      "920.1s - and so they're often provided\n",
      "by these like vendor libraries\n",
      "922.44s - like cuBLAS or like QDNN.\n",
      "925.289s - And like you know, they're\n",
      "provided by NVIDIA.\n",
      "926.76s - and they're like very hand optimized\n",
      "928.65s - and so, you know, if 90% of\n",
      "your time is spent in matmuls,\n",
      "931.65s - then like what else can you\n",
      "even do to like optimize\n",
      "934.2s - the performance of your neural network?\n",
      "937.92s - And I think another\n",
      "kind of interesting like\n",
      "942.87s - important piece here for like\n",
      "why PyTorch's performance\n",
      "945.15s - was like quite good is\n",
      "that it had this like\n",
      "947.37s - Async execution model.\n",
      "949.5s - Where basically the idea here\n",
      "is that like you kind of have\n",
      "952.23s - like a parallel work queue on your GPU.\n",
      "954.93s - And so what the CPU does is\n",
      "that it's only responsible\n",
      "957.84s - for scheduling work on your work queue\n",
      "959.91s - and then you know, the GPU\n",
      "executes work from the work queue\n",
      "963.36s - and I think of it\n",
      "generally as like this GIF\n",
      "966.21s - is what usually comes to mind\n",
      "and basically you can imagine\n",
      "968.76s - that like the dog is like,\n",
      "970.98s - or Gromit is like Python, you\n",
      "know, they're like, you know,\n",
      "973.56s - trying to put down the train\n",
      "track in front of the train,\n",
      "976.14s - which is the GPU.\n",
      "977.49s - And so, you know, as long\n",
      "as like Gromit is able\n",
      "980.49s - to put down the train\n",
      "tracks faster than the train\n",
      "983.01s - actually rolls along the train tracks,\n",
      "985.11s - you can actually kind of view Python\n",
      "986.88s - as like having zero overhead.\n",
      "988.86s - Like it doesn't provide\n",
      "any extra cost compared to,\n",
      "992.61s - you know, if Python was like\n",
      "in a more efficient language\n",
      "994.68s - like C++.\n",
      "997.65s - And so in this way like you know,\n",
      "999.167s - eager execution not only\n",
      "had like a much easier\n",
      "1001.7s - to understand program model for users,\n",
      "1003.68s - it was also like basically just as fast\n",
      "1006.62s - as like non eager execution.\n",
      "1010.4s - Unfortunately, you know,\n",
      "good things that never last.\n",
      "1013.19s - And in 2017 like NVIDIA introduced\n",

      "hardware units on the GPUs\n",
      "1023.96s - that only do matmul operations.\n",
      "1026.15s - Like, and I don't mean this\n",
      "like figuratively in the sense\n",
      "1029.87s - that like people often\n",
      "say that GPUs are like\n",
      "1031.49s - well suited for matmuls.\n",
      "1033.05s - I mean this like very literally\n",
      "1034.85s - in that like there's actually\n",
      "an assembly instruction\n",
      "1036.77s - that just does like a mini matmul.\n",
      "1038.99s - And this is how you like\n",

      "versus non-matmul flops,\n",
      "1048.14s - you can really see like\n",
      "when NVIDIA realized\n",
      "1051.71s - that like deep learning was a big deal.\n",
      "1053.93s - Because like all, all\n",
      "of a sudden, you know,\n",
      "1055.46s - you kind of had this\n",
      "like massive like 10x gap\n",
      "1057.89s - and so there's like a log scale.\n",
      "1059.57s - And you had this kinda\n",

      "everything else like stayed\n",
      "1081.74s - the same amount of speed,\n",
      "1083.0s - then all of a sudden, you\n",
      "know, like you're spending\n",
      "1085.88s - a lot more of your time doing\n",
      "like non-matmul operations.\n",
      "1090.41s - And so as a result we've kind\n",

      "1464.87s - But the actual thing\n",
      "is that like, you know,\n",
      "1466.19s - this power doesn't just\n",
      "like come from nowhere.\n",
      "1469.43s - It actually largely\n",
      "comes from what's called\n",
      "1471.47s - like dynamic or switching power.\n",
      "1473.87s - And what this means is like\n",
      "every time a transistor\n",
      "1476.21s - like on the GPU switches\n",
      "from like zero to one\n",
      "1479.03s - or like, you know, high\n",
      "to low or low to high,\n",
      "1481.16s - it like loses a little bit of this power.\n",
      "1483.89s - And so the actual like\n",
      "power usage on your GPU\n",
      "1486.35s - is kind of like a like sum\n",
      "across the total amount\n",
      "1489.35s - of like switching that\n",
      "goes on in your GPU.\n",
      "1493.37s - And so this is why like\n",

      "don't end up switching at all.\n",
      "1500.63s - And so like it doesn't actually\n",
      "consume that much power\n",
      "1503.12s - and it's much less a throttle.\n",
      "1505.64s - And so if you actually like look at this,\n",
      "1508.64s - you can actually get like\n",
      "very different performance\n",
      "1510.44s - for like all these different\n",
      "kind of fund distributions.\n",
      "1512.84s - Like whether it's like, you\n",

      "1516.17s - or whether it's like a\n",
      "checkerboard type like pattern\n",
      "1518.87s - or you know, it's like sparse or ternary.\n",
      "1520.88s - And the reason why is just like,\n",
      "1522.56s - it's like this kind of abstract thing\n",

      "lead to like more or less\n",

      "1535.28s - And so I remember actually\n",
      "one time somebody had told me\n",

      "1541.13s - the machine learning model\n",

      "1543.5s - And then they like at some\n",

      "1547.16s - and then they'd be like wow my performance\n",
      "1548.63s - just got way better (chuckles).\n",
      "1550.82s - And so I like wrote an article about this\n",
      "1553.1s - and they like messaged me and\n",
      "they were like, oh you know,\n",
      "1554.81s - that was very illustrative\n",
      "1557.27s - because you know, I was really confused\n",
      "1558.29s - why my performance\n",

      "need to do a lot of flipping\n",

      "measure like a better perf.\n",
      "1569.99s - So that's kind of compute.\n",
      "1571.37s - And so the next thing that\n",

      "what actually happens\n",
      "1711.8s - when you do these operations.\n",

      "1806.66s - that program model is\n",

      "1811.04s - And so there's actually\n",

      "1815.27s - Although at the end of the day,\n",

      "1828.47s - One of the kind of examples here\n",

      "1833.15s - If you guys are kind\n",
      "of familiar with maybe\n",
      "1834.65s - like register allocation type settings,\n",
      "1836.6s - you kind of often have a similar issue\n",
      "1839.0s - where like if you have a\n",

      "1851.96s - And so you kind of have\n",

      "1879.83s - to mention actually about like why.\n",
      "1882.38s - So this observation actually ends up being\n",
      "1883.67s - like quite important for\n",

      "1885.41s - like re computation versus reuse.\n",

      "1889.58s - of machine learning programs,\n",
      "1891.26s - actually I think it looks quite unusual\n",
      "1893.09s - compared to like your typical\n",
      "program that you might have.\n",
      "1895.97s - Where like it's generally like\n",
      "a kind of a bit of an axiom\n",
      "1899.72s - in like programs that\n",
      "usually most intermediates\n",
      "1901.613s - that you have are very short-lived.\n",
      "1903.68s - So like, you know, your\n",
      "program generally consists\n",
      "1905.66s - of a lot of very short-lived intermediates\n",
      "1907.13s - that you know are created\n",
      "1908.45s - and they're very shortly destroyed.\n",
      "1910.61s - But in machine learning this\n",
      "is actually not the case.\n",
      "1913.34s - Because in machine learning,\n",
      "like the typical like model\n",
      "1916.34s - that you'll execute will\n",
      "first like run the model\n",
      "1919.4s - forward like, you know,\n",
      "layer zero to layer one,\n",
      "1921.59s - to layer two, to layer\n",
      "three, to layer four,\n",
      "1923.84s - and then initially run what's\n",
      "called the backwards pass,\n",
      "1926.39s - which will like run the layers in reverse.\n",
      "1929.27s - So then it'll go from like\n",
      "layer four to layer three,\n",
      "1931.19s - to layer two, to layer\n",
      "one and to layer zero.\n",
      "1933.74s - And in between the forward pass\n",
      "1935.6s - and the backwards pass you need to save\n",
      "1937.58s - what are called like\n",
      "intermediates or activations.\n",
      "1940.97s - And so these are like a lot of, like,\n",
      "1943.79s - you have a lot of them.\n",
      "1945.14s - And they're like often\n",
      "times like, you know,\n",
      "1947.42s - largely responsible for like running into\n",
      "1949.67s - like out of memory type errors.\n",
      "1951.98s - And so I think this is actually\n",
      "1953.39s - like kind of a pretty unusual\n",
      "like program structure\n",
      "1957.2s - in machine learning that's\n",
      "caused like, you know,\n",
      "1959.6s - back propagation and gradient dissent.\n",
      "1965.42s - And so finally, you know, the last thing\n",
      "1966.83s - you can be spending your\n",
      "time on is overhead.\n",
      "1969.23s - Where you can imagine that,\n",
      "1970.1s - you know, if a poor Gromit is not able\n",
      "1972.53s - to put down the train\n",
      "tracks faster than the train\n",
      "1975.44s - can like go on the train tracks,\n",
      "1977.06s - then sometimes a train\n",
      "is gonna be just stuck\n",
      "1979.55s - waiting for him to put down\n",
      "like the next train track.\n",
      "1982.28s - And so here I have like a profile trace\n",
      "1985.49s - where you can see that\n",

      "idle waiting for the CPU\n",
      "1992.12s - to like schedule the next operation.\n",
      "1995.54s - And so there are a lot of like ways\n",
      "1996.83s - to actually address this nowadays.\n",
      "1998.69s - One of the most powerful\n",
      "is called CUDAgraphs,\n",
      "2000.91s - which is like an NVIDIA provided API,\n",
      "2004.214s - but you also have like other\n",
      "approaches like in a compiler\n",
      "2006.31s - for example, like codegenning\n",
      "like a lower overhead wrapper\n",
      "2009.25s - or something like this.\n",
      "2016.922s - So you know, I've talked\n",

      "they can do to your program\n",

      "2024.37s - But I think kind of like\n",

      "2027.04s - that you often see like, you\n",
      "know, I talked a lot about\n",

      "architecture looks like.\n",
      "2039.58s - And so I think like a\n",
      "reasonable question is like,\n",
      "2041.83s - if you only have like one architecture\n",

      "2045.73s - why do you even need a compiler?\n",

      "2062.47s - and the other thing I'll say about this\n",
      "2064.78s - actually is that like in\n",

      "2067.93s - people do not use compilers\n",

      "to establish my credibility,\n",
      "2093.685s - you know, I work on a team\n",
      "called Fighter's Compilers.\n",
      "2096.01s - And so there are like, to be\n",
      "clear like a lot of reasons\n",
      "2098.5s - why compilers can be very useful.\n",
      "2100.57s - In particular this kinda\n",

      "2133.15s - it also has no documentation about\n",

      "3220.41s - when it comes to like\n",
      "making GPUs run at scale.\n",

      "3236.16s - is that traditional distributed systems\n",
      "3237.99s - are oftentimes are just\n",
      "trying to scale a QPS.\n",
      "3240.87s - And so when you're like\n",
      "trying to scale QPS,\n",
      "3242.367s - you have a lot of like very\n",
      "small interchangeable queries\n",
      "3245.61s - and like the performance per hardware\n",
      "3247.35s - is not like that critical.\n",
      "3249.57s - And then oftentimes you're\n",
      "willing to like double\n",
      "3251.31s - your amount of hardware use\n",
      "3252.69s - in order to get like fall tolerance\n",
      "3254.28s - or like, you know, like higher\n",
      "uptime or things like this.\n",
      "3257.37s - On the other hand, in ML systems,\n",
      "3259.92s - we just basically have\n",
      "like a single query.\n",
      "3262.26s - Like, you know, you're just\n",
      "like training your ML job.\n",
      "3264.78s - We have frequent global synchronizations\n",
      "3266.58s - across all of our hardware and performance\n",
      "3270.18s - is like extremely important,\n",
      "3271.26s - you know, so much so\n",
      "that like there's no way\n",
      "3273.0s - we could tolerate like\n",
      "a 2x loss in performance\n",
      "3276.18s - for basically any reason.\n",
      "3280.92s - And so one way to kind of think about\n",
      "3282.93s - how you can paralyze programs.\n",
      "3284.79s - And this is actually\n",
      "like not specific to ML,\n",
      "3286.71s - this is kind of a general,\n",
      "3287.88s - like a way to think about\n",
      "paralyzing programs.\n",
      "3290.13s - Is that you can think\n",
      "that there's basically a,\n",
      "3292.05s - like you have like this\n",
      "cube of computation to do.\n",
      "3296.01s - Where one of the dimensions\n",
      "is like the batch dimension.\n",
      "3300.45s - So it's like different\n",
      "tasks that you can perform.\n",
      "3303.06s - You also have like the\n",
      "within task dimension,\n",
      "3305.34s - so like the different\n",
      "operations within a single task.\n",
      "3308.4s - And then finally you have\n",
      "like the time dimension,\n",
      "3310.59s - which is what your GPU is doing\n",
      "at any given point in time.\n",
      "3316.11s - And so you can think of data parallelism\n",
      "3317.34s - as basically just splitting\n",
      "along like the batch dimension.\n",
      "3320.61s - You can think about like task parallelism\n",
      "3322.35s - as splitting across a task dimension.\n",
      "3324.51s - And then you think about\n",
      "pipeline parallelism\n",
      "3325.77s - as kind of like splitting\n",
      "across the time dimension.\n",
      "3331.38s - Yeah, and so for data parallelism,\n",
      "3333.93s - like the basic idea I think\n",
      "is like pretty simple,\n",
      "3336.57s - which is just that we have like\n",
      "a bunch of different tasks.\n",
      "3338.76s - We have a bunch of parallelism,\n",
      "3340.17s - and so each GPU just\n",
      "handles a different task.\n",
      "3342.99s - And so because of that\n",
      "we just have like...\n",
      "3345.56s - We just put one task on\n",
      "each GPU and then run it.\n",
      "3348.48s - And this seems like very\n",
      "nice and very trivial,\n",
      "3351.0s - but the issue is that like we\n",
      "have a massive synchronization\n",
      "3353.52s - of parameters after every step.\n",
      "3355.62s - Because after every step\n",
      "that we do like the gradients\n",
      "3359.43s - need to be like synchronized\n",
      "across all of your hardware.\n",
      "3363.06s - And you can't just like\n",
      "avoid synchronizing\n",
      "3366.63s - your parameters because you\n",
      "also have this kind of like,\n",
      "3371.37s - mathy constraint from\n",
      "like the ML training side,\n",
      "3374.49s - which is that you simply can't\n",
      "train with like too large\n",
      "3376.56s - of a batch size or your model\n",
      "will not converge properly.\n",
      "3382.5s - There's also kind of another detail here\n",
      "3384.33s - where like you can't just like naively\n",
      "3385.74s - replicate your parameters.\n",
      "3387.21s - People oftentimes use like what's called\n",
      "3389.28s - a Fully-Sharded Data Parallel.\n",
      "3393.21s - The second kind of parallelism\n",
      "3394.043s - that you have is like task parallelism,\n",
      "3396.27s - which is commonly known\n",
      "as tensor parallelism.\n",
      "3398.22s - And in this case you\n",
      "basically just have two GPUs\n",
      "3400.26s - that split the same task.\n",
      "3402.06s - And so the main problem\n",
      "that you run into here\n",
      "3403.83s - that's kind of specific to ML\n",
      "is that like task parallelism\n",
      "3407.1s - because you're like running the same task\n",
      "3409.08s - does not oftentimes have like obvious ways\n",
      "3411.84s - to overlap your communication\n",
      "with your computation.\n",
      "3415.26s - But nevertheless, because the\n",
      "performance is so important,\n",
      "3418.2s - we still really want to\n",
      "overlap the communication.\n",
      "3420.87s - And so there ends up being like a lot\n",
      "3422.16s - of kind of involved things that people do\n",
      "3424.86s - to try to improve the overlap.\n",
      "3427.02s - One of them here is called\n",
      "like Async Tensor Parallelism.\n",
      "3430.2s - Where the general idea here\n",
      "3431.25s - is they have like a communication op\n",
      "3433.05s - followed by like a computation operation.\n",
      "3435.27s - And so usually, you know,\n",
      "3436.17s - while you're doing the communication,\n",
      "3437.82s - the CPU can't do any computation\n",
      "3439.71s - and so this is like, you know,\n",

      "3444.06s - But the observation here\n",
      "about Async Tensor Parallelism\n",
      "3446.84s - is you can actually kind\n",
      "of like mini pipeline\n",
      "3449.82s - your like communication and your matmul.\n",
      "3452.52s - Where even within like a\n",

       "['0s - - So it\\'s my great pleasure 2s - to introduce our speaker tonight, Horace He. 4s - Horace He graduated from Cornell in 2020, 8s - and he works at Meta on the PyTorch team, 11s - specifically at the intersection 13s - of compilers and machine learning. 16s - If you\\'ve used things like torch.compile, 19s - which is a thing in PyTorch 20s - that makes your model goes 21s - like 2-4x faster in just one line of code. 24s - Or if you\\'ve used FlexAttention, 25s - which is something that lets researcher 28s - design fast kernel for attention 30s - without leaving the world of Python. 33s - He\\'s the person responsible for both of those things. 36s - You should also check his blog, which is pretty awesome, 38s - and in particular the blog post 40s - \"Making Deep Learning go Brrrr From First Principles.\" 44s - And without further ado, I\\'ll give it to Horace. 47s - - Thanks for the intro. 48s - Today I\\'m gonna give a talk about 49s - building machine learning systems 51s - for a trillion, trillion floating point operations. 54s - My name is Horace He, 55s - and I\\'m on the PyTorch compilers team at Meta. 59s - So, you know, I think we live in pretty unprecedented times 62s - in terms of an infrastructure build out, 65s - which is, I think, you know, 65s - nicely reflected in NVIDIA\\'s stock price. 69s - I feel like, you know, basically every month, 71s - we see like a different headline 72s - about like a new nuclear power plant 74s - from like Microsoft, or, you know, 76s - like a massive 300K GPU data cluster from xAI. 80s - You know, people like, 81s - I feel like when Amazon first like built like a, 84s - or like bought a nuclear power center, 86s - it was like a big news. 87s - But now practically like, you know, 88s - every cool AI company 90s - has their like own nuclear data center. 95s - And you know, of course, 96s - this like kind of really massive (indistinct) build out 98s - has kind of also resulted in pretty ludicrous fundraisers 101s - from startups, I think. 102s - Like, I remember back in like 2016, like, 104s - you know, if you like made it as a startup, 107s - it would be like if you were worth a billion dollars, right? 109s - It was like a unicorn. 110s - It was like the mark of like really making it 111s - as a startup beyond your wildest dreams. 114s - But you know, in 2024, you know, 115s - you gotta raise a billion dollars just like get started. 118s - You know, it\\'s like just to play the game, (laughs) 120s - you need like a billion dollars, you know, 122s - of which most of it goes to NVIDIA (chuckles). 125s - (audience laughs) 128s - And so I think like, it\\'s kind of crazy to think that, 132s - you know, all of this, like, you know, 133s - billions of dollars is really just to do 134s - like absolutely insane amount 136s - of floating point operations. 138s - Here\\'s like a nice chart from like Epoch AI 140s - showing like the growth of compute over time. 144s - And like, these floating point operations 147s - are really just like big matmuls 149s - done like over and over, like, you know, 151s - for millions of iterations over like months. 154s - And nowadays, 155s - like the leading edge models are currently trained 157s - with about like one E26 floating point operations, 160s - which is approximately 100 trillion 164s - trillion floating point operations. 166s - So like a trillion trillion, like a trillion TeraFLOPS 171s - worth of floating point operations. 173s - And so, you know, back, you know, another kind of effect 176s - that you might\\'ve noticed is like back prior to 2016, 179s - if you search on like Hacker news like ML, 181s - you\\'d often get like a lot of people asking about, you know, 183s - the ML family of languages. 185s - But nowadays, you know, you search ML on a hacker news 189s - and you get like a very different like type of article. 195s - And so I think one of the things 196s - that kind of is missed here is like, you know, 198s - with all these like billions of dollars 200s - and like, you know, yottaflop of operations, 202s - it\\'s kind of easy to forget that, you know, 203s - like these operations needed to actually run somehow 207s - on the like machines. 210s - And so, you know, a modern stack might involve, you know, 213s - like, you know, call like an LLM API 215s - and then it\\'s called like PyTorch, like NCCL, Triton, CUDA 218s - like NVCC, like all these like different layers in the stack 221s - that like somebody was involved in writing. 224s - And I\\'m often reminded of this like XK CD comic, you know, 228s - showing like the state of like modern digital infrastructure 231s - and so, you know, you kind of, you know, 233s - often have forget about all the infrastructure 234s - that was involved for you to like get where you are, 238s - but like really we\\'re just kind of building 239s - like layers on top of layers. 243s - And so, you know, if you work in a systems, you know, 245s - like I do and I suspect many of you do, you kind of, 248s - I think oftentimes think about your work a little bit like, 251s - like a benevolent dictator of sorts. 254s - Where kind of you imagine like what you\\'re doing here 256s - is that like a lot of people build on top of your work. 258s - And so if you can kind of, you know, 260s - give like a small amount improvement to, you know, 262s - like millions of people, you know, 264s - your small improvements can lead to like, you know, 266s - significant impacts on the world. 268s - And so for example, I kind of imagine like Guido, 271s - with Python, you just like, you know, kind of sits on top 273s - of this cloud and you know, eventually like gives us like 275s - NoGil or like faster CPython or like the Walrus Operator 278s - and I feel like this is kind of oftentimes like 281s - how I imagine like infrastructure work did. 284s - And it\\'s kind of a lot of why I got into infra work 286s - in the first place. 289s - And so on the other hand, I feel like if you work in ML, 291s - things can sometimes feel a little bit different. 293s - I originally came across this a post on threads 296s - where this person said, you know, my main gripe 298s - with like working on top of like LM APIs 300s - is that you\\'re not really like, 301s - no one is like engineering anything. 303s - You\\'re just like chanting like a prayer 306s - to this like manmade demon deity to like do your bidding. 310s - And this like very similar to this kind of like 312s - Shoggoth metaphor that has become like very popular 314s - in deep learning circles. 316s - Where the idea here is that like we really like 318s - put all these like matmuls 319s - and like computation into producing this like very weird 323s - alien intelligence. 324s - and then we like kind of like RLHF it, you know, 328s - and like provide it in this like nice convenient interface 330s - to people with like, you know, ChatGPT 333s - or something like that. 335s - But you know, I think if you think about it, 337s - I think we\\'re kind of working with Shoggoths 339s - like all the way down. 342s - Like even like if you\\'re working like in systems 346s - and you\\'re not calling like ML models, 348s - you still have this kinda like, you know, 349s - massive amount of infrastructure that you presumably 351s - don\\'t really understand written by people 354s - you\\'ve probably never talked to. 355s - And like the end result know they try to expose 358s - is like some kind of a simple interface 360s - where you can just like import torch 362s - and then, you know, hopefully run your code across like, 364s - you know, a 100K GPUs. 368s - And so I think as a result there are some, 371s - I think, interesting ways in which I think ML models 373s - that feel kind of different from regular systems. 376s - One of those ways is that like ML models 380s - are extremely simple and as a result 384s - we have like very high expectations 385s - from the performance of like the code. 389s - I think it kind of like trace this all the way back 391s - to this very nice article called the \"Bitter Lesson,\" 394s - which I\\'d really recommend reading if you guys 395s - haven\\'t come across it before. 397s - Where their main observation here was that like, 400s - clever ideas in machine learning have basically 403s - throughout like its 50 year history always lost out 406s - to just simple ideas that like scaled really well 409s - with Moore\\'s law. 412s - And I\\'m not really like joking here when I say 414s - that like machine learning logic is exceedingly simple. 417s - There\\'s like this cool project from someone 419s - called like Andre Pathy called llama2.c. 422s - And basically here he\\'s like implemented 425s - like llama2 in about like 973 lines of C. 428s - With like no other dependencies. 430s - Like, you know, every single loop, 431s - every single like matmul is just implemented from scratch. 434s - So with 973 lines, you can\\'t like, you know, 436s - do it very fast, but it does run 439s - and I think it does kind of indicate just like 441s - how fundamentally simple the models 443s - that like we\\'re spending all this compute end up being. 448s - And so the end result like 449s - although like the problem themselves are extremely simple 452s - and like very like easy to optimize in some sense. 457s - The expectations are very high 459s - for how well we can optimize these matmuls. 461s - So one example here is that like the predominant metric 464s - for measuring your like model\\'s performance in deep learning 468s - is called model FLOP utilization. 470s - And so this is basically the like percentage 472s - of the theoretical max flops that your GPU is able to do. 477s - And so if you kind of think about this, 479s - this is actually like a very absurd metric to hit. 482s - Like if on a CPU, like you measured any of your code 484s - by this metric, like you can only hit a 100% 487s - if like at every single time every single core 490s - of your CPU is always issuing max width SIMD instructions. 494s - That\\'s like the only way you can hit a 100% utilization. 498s - And so, you know, if you take a look at any of the code 500s - that you guys presumably write, 502s - like almost no CPU code is like anywhere near like, 505s - you know, a 100% flop. 506s - It\\'s probably like way under like 1% most of the time. 510s - On the other hand, in like machine learning 512s - for like large scale training, we\\'re typically often hitting 514s - around like 50% of like the peak flops. 518s - And this is I think like this is kinda like a indicative 522s - that like even though the overall problem 523s - is like very simple, the kind of corresponding difficulty 526s - just goes into like making your like models hit 530s - like this, like very high perf barrier. 535s - Another ind of a interesting observation 537s - in like machine learning is that, 540s - that has kind of exacerbated this a bit. 542s - Is that the field has consolidated significantly 544s - over the last five to 10 years. 547s - So one of them is that like, you know, 548s - like maybe 10 years ago you had like a lot more architecture 551s - is a lot more variance and like different things 553s - that people were trying. 554s - But nowadays people really just like transformers are like 558s - the dominant architecture for everything. 559s - Like you have transformers for vision, you have transformers 561s - for language, you have transformers for like, you know, 563s - audio, it\\'s kind of like all transformers. 566s - And the other way like things have kind of changed 568s - is that instead of like, you know, many different people 572s - training SOTA models. 573s - You oftentimes just have a few companies 575s - that are training SOTA models. 576s - And so we\\'ve kind of gone from a bit of like a monopoly 579s - where like, you know, previously there was this like, 581s - you know, one person providing the infra 583s - and like many people using the infra, 585s - to in some ways it feels a little bit more like monopsony 588s - where you have like many people trying to provide infra 590s - and then you know, only one person\\'s actually training 592s - the job at the end of the day. 597s - And so as a kind of result, I think that like 600s - there\\'s kind of two general ways to think about 602s - like getting performance from like your systems. 606s - And so one of the ways generally is basically 608s - like optimizations is like you have a compiler, 610s - you like make the compiler faster, you know, 613s - you improve like the performance 614s - of everybody using your compiler. 617s - and so the other way though 618s - is kind of like programming models. 620s - And so like this is kind of analogous 621s - as opposed to like a system whose responsibility 624s - is to like chop down a tree 626s - and then you know, you\\'re just like optimizing 627s - how fast you can chop down the tree. 629s - And the other alternative is like you\\'re providing tools 631s - for people to cut down the trees themselves. 635s - And so to kind of like talk a little bit 637s - about programming models, I think it\\'s like illustrative 640s - to kind of talk about how like ML frameworks 642s - have kind of evolved in terms of what program model 645s - they\\'ve exposed to users. 647s - So originally like I think like 2010, 651s - like 2011, 2012, the first like ML framework 654s - that kind of got a lot of popularity was this framework 656s - called Caffe. 657s - And the way you like express neural networks in Caffe 659s - is like a very declarative nature. 662s - And by that I mean you like edited a protobuf file I think. 666s - Where like the protobuf like specified all the things 668s - you needed like care about your neural network. 671s - And so as you can imagine, you know, 672s - programming protobufs is like not very fun, you know, 675s - there\\'s a lot of things you might want to do 677s - that you can\\'t do in protobufs. 678s - and so a like natural net thing that people did 681s - was kind of these kind of graph builder type APIs. 684s - And so this is kind of, you know, how TensorFlow 1 686s - kinda of look like where the idea is that oh, you know, 689s - like programming like, you know, programming protobufs 691s - or like no human should need to write protobufs by hand. 694s - And so ideally, you know, 696s - you should just like write like a DSL of sorts 699s - that allows you to generate the protobufs 701s - like from this DSL. 703s - However, like even this DSL still kind of has 706s - like a lot of confusion in it. 708s - Like it is not super clear that like given this DSL 710s - like how code actually executes on your GPU. 714s - And so kind of finally like around 2016 or 2017, 718s - PyTorch started to become like really successful. 720s - And kind of the like the feature 723s - that like was most emblematic of PyTorch was basically 726s - what was called imperative or eager execution. 729s - And so what this means is that like, 734s - or like, yeah, so PyTorch you know, was very successful 736s - and I think it\\'s like worth talking about 737s - like why eager execution was so successful. 740s - And I think that the main reason it was successful, 742s - it just comes down to like what the programming model 744s - of the execution looked like. 746s - Where in a imperative slash like eager execution 748s - is basically like, you know, you call a function, 751s - the GPU runs a function 753s - and then the function finishes and you know, that\\'s it. 756s - Like, you know, like that\\'s basically all you do. 757s - you call like torch.matmul and this is basically 760s - the sequence of operations that happens but you know, 763s - with kind of like a graph mode type approach 765s - or you know, where kind of this pilot interjects. 767s - You first like define the function, 769s - the function gets converted into some like intermediate IR, 773s - you know, a bunch of who knows what happens to your function 776s - and then eventually like the function eventually executes 779s - on the GPU. 780s - And like the top one was like a very simple 784s - execution model for people to understand. 787s - And I think another thing that\\'s kind of interesting 789s - to notice about this is that this kind of also just, 791s - like the top half also kind of describes 794s - how Python executes. 797s - And I think this is kind of a pretty illustrative to me 799s - of like why Python has been so successful 801s - in machine learning. 803s - It\\'s basically that like, like a funny statement 806s - that you can make about Python is that like if you tried 809s - to like train a model today, like you know, 812s - I gave you like a day to like train a model, 815s - it would run faster if you ran it in Python 817s - compared to doing in C++. 819s - And you might argue that this is like a unfair comparison. 823s - Because you know, like you know all the infra like, 825s - you know, all the frameworks that people built 826s - are in Python. 827s - But I think the reason why so many 829s - of these frameworks have been built in Python 831s - is that Python is like an exceedingly like 833s - a simple language. 835s - And so it\\'s also like a very global language. 838s - And what I mean by like global is that like it\\'s very easy 840s - for people to build their own infrastructure 842s - on top of Python without really needing to fight 845s - with like anything the Python language does 847s - because the Python language itself does basically nothing. 851s - Like it, you know, it doesn\\'t do any optimizations for you. 853s - It just like, you know, takes your function and runs it. 857s - And so I think that PyTorch basically historically 860s - is at like a very similar point in the design space. 863s - Where PyTorch is like execution model is like so very simple 868s - and although this like doesn\\'t really give you a lot 870s - in terms of like, it doesn\\'t like automatically 872s - do a lot of things for you, it does mean that it\\'s very easy 875s - for people to like build their own infrastructure 878s - and frameworks on top of PyTorch. 887s - I think another important detail to realize 890s - especially about like PyTorch when it first came out. 893s - Is that like this kind of unoptimized execution 896s - didn\\'t actually even sacrifice any performance at all. 899s - Like, you know when people kind of benchmarked 900s - PyTorch versus like, you know, TensorFlow at Cafe, 903s - PyTorch oftentimes wasn\\'t even slower than those frameworks. 907s - And I think there\\'s like a two main reasons for this. 909s - So the first reason is that back in the day, 912s - like you know about like 90% plus of your time 914s - was spent in matmuls. 915s - And so there\\'s basically nothing else you need to optimize. 918s - And so matmuls here are like matrix implications 920s - and so they\\'re often provided by these like vendor libraries 922s - like cuBLAS or like QDNN. 925s - And like you know, they\\'re provided by NVIDIA. 927s - and they\\'re like very hand optimized 929s - and so, you know, if 90% of your time is spent in matmuls, 932s - then like what else can you even do to like optimize 934s - the performance of your neural network? 938s - And I think another kind of interesting like 943s - important piece here for like why PyTorch\\'s performance 945s - was like quite good is that it had this like 947s - Async execution model. 950s - Where basically the idea here is that like you kind of have 952s - like a parallel work queue on your GPU. 955s - And so what the CPU does is that it\\'s only responsible 958s - for scheduling work on your work queue 960s - and then you know, the GPU executes work from the work queue 963s - and I think of it generally as like this GIF 966s - is what usually comes to mind and basically you can imagine 969s - that like the dog is like, 971s - or Gromit is like Python, you know, they\\'re like, you know, 974s - trying to put down the train track in front of the train, 976s - which is the GPU. 977s - And so, you know, as long as like Gromit is able 980s - to put down the train tracks faster than the train 983s - actually rolls along the train tracks, 985s - you can actually kind of view Python 987s - as like having zero overhead. 989s - Like it doesn\\'t provide any extra cost compared to, 993s - you know, if Python was like in a more efficient language 995s - like C++. 998s - And so in this way like you know, 999s - eager execution not only had like a much easier 1002s - to understand program model for users, 1004s - it was also like basically just as fast 1007s - as like non eager execution. 1010s - Unfortunately, you know, good things that never last. 1013s - And in 2017 like NVIDIA introduced 1016s - what are called like tensor cores. 1019s - And if you guys are unfamiliar with tensor cores, 1021s - they\\'re basically like hardware units on the GPUs 1024s - that only do matmul operations. 1026s - Like, and I don\\'t mean this like figuratively in the sense 1030s - that like people often say that GPUs are like 1031s - well suited for matmuls. 1033s - I mean this like very literally 1035s - in that like there\\'s actually an assembly instruction 1037s - that just does like a mini matmul. 1039s - And this is how you like interact with the tensor cores. 1042s - And so if you look at this like plot of like the amount 1045s - of like matmul flops versus non-matmul flops, 1048s - you can really see like when NVIDIA realized 1052s - that like deep learning was a big deal. 1054s - Because like all, all of a sudden, you know, 1055s - you kind of had this like massive like 10x gap 1058s - and so there\\'s like a log scale. 1060s - And you had this kinda like massive like 10x gap 1062s - between how fast matmuls were on the GPU 1065s - and how fast like literally anything else 1067s - you wanted to run on the GPU was. 1071s - And so the end result is, you know, previously we said 1073s - that like, you know, matmuls took like 90% of the time 1076s - and so if the, if like, you know, NVIDIA has fed up matmuls 1079s - by like 10x but then everything else like stayed 1082s - the same amount of speed, 1083s - then all of a sudden, you know, like you\\'re spending 1086s - a lot more of your time doing like non-matmul operations. 1090s - And so as a result we\\'ve kind of gotten like ML compilers 1095s - I think largely due to this change. 1097s - And so one of the, I think the important details 1099s - about ML compilers like, you know, 1101s - in terms of like how they differ from the frameworks 1102s - that came before is that ML frameworks still keep 1106s - like the eager programming model and that like the code 1109s - that you write like logically the program model 1111s - exposed to users is that you\\'re still just writing 1113s - Python code and executes like line by line. 1116s - The only difference now is that instead 1117s - of actually executing line by line, 1119s - we kind of captured into like a graph in some manner. 1123s - And so Torch compile I think actually kind of does this 1125s - in a pretty interesting way. 1127s - And that torch compile actually like intercepts 1131s - at like the Python by code interpreter level. 1134s - Where Python kind of exposes these APIs 1136s - where you can kind of insert 1137s - your like own frame interpreter. 1139s - And so this looks very much just like a traditional 1141s - like you know, Git for like any kind of other VM. 1144s - except this Git is kind of, you know, 1145s - only meant for like PyTorch programs. 1150s - And so if you kind of look at like, you know 1152s - how like things have evolved over time. 1155s - Originally you kind of had like frameworks like TensorFlow 1157s - or Caffe before that. 1159s - Where both the user like program model that users wrote 1162s - was like a graph builder type attraction. 1165s - But then the execution programming model 1166s - was also a graph execution type extraction. 1169s - And then like after that you kind of had PyTorch, you know, 1172s - one type like stuff. 1175s - Where the user program model now switched 1176s - to like an eager style execution, but the execution program 1179s - and the execution program model was also eager where like, 1182s - you know, each operator\\'s executed one at a time. 1186s - But kind of now finally, you know, 1187s - modern ML frameworks like, 1189s - pretty much all ML frameworks nowadays 1191s - use like an imperative eager programming model. 1194s - But almost all ML frameworks now also have some way 1197s - to like capture this program model into a graph of some kind 1201s - so they can perform optimizations. 1202s - And so this is like, you know, JAX.git, Tonnegrad, 1205s - this is like MLX. 1207s - They kind of all have their like different approaches 1208s - for capturing the graph to optimize. 1216s - And so I think next I kinda wanna talk about, you know, 1218s - we\\'ve kind of discussed how we\\'ve gotten to ML compilers 1222s - in the first place. 1223s - And so I think next I wanna talk about like 1225s - what ML compilers are actually doing for you 1228s - and what kind of optimizations they\\'re performing. 1231s - And so generally speaking, the way I think about 1234s - deep learning performance or like performance on GPUs 1236s - in general is that there\\'s basically three things 1238s - you can be spending your time on. 1240s - The first one is compute, so this is time on our GPU 1243s - competing like actual floating point operations. 1246s - The next one is a memory which is, you know, 1248s - time spent transferring your tensors within a GPU. 1252s - So this is like, you know, across various memory subsystems 1255s - in your GPU. 1256s - And so finally like overhead, 1258s - which is like everything else like you know, 1259s - it\\'s like time your GPU spending idle and so on. 1263s - And so first we\\'re gonna talk about compute. 1266s - And so I think to a sum of approximation you can say 1270s - that all runtime on your GPU is either compute 1272s - or it\\'s a shuffling data. 1274s - And that like, you know, data movement 1277s - is like not like a real operation, right? 1280s - it\\'s like a no op from like the theoretical point of view. 1284s - All it\\'s doing is it\\'s moving data from one place 1286s - where it\\'s convenient to another place 1287s - where it\\'s convenient. 1288s - And so basically a floating point operation 1290s - is like the only real thing a GPU can do. 1294s - But you can actually, I think simplify this even more 1296s - and say that in reality actually nowadays like all runtime 1300s - is either like matmuls or essentially shuffling data. 1303s - And so this is like, because if you look at the actual like 1306s - flop chart on like an Edge 100 like GPU, you can see here 1310s - that like the FP32 flops is like 1313s - you only have 67 teraFLOPS of FB32 compute, 1317s - but you actually have like a 1,00 teraFLOPS 1319s - of a TF32 compute. 1321s - Which is basically like matrix multiplication compute. 1324s - And so what this essentially... 1326s - And sometimes like what this means 1327s - is that if you\\'re not doing measurable (indistinct) 1329s - on your GPU, you\\'re really only like getting like 7% 1334s - of like your peak FLOP utilization. 1336s - And so like, you know by like the metric 1337s - that I mentioned before like model FLOP utilization, 1340s - even if your GPU was fully occupied doing stuff 1343s - that wasn\\'t a matmul you could only ever get like 7% 1346s - of FLOP utilization, which is like much lower than, 1349s - you know, our theoretical peak. 1355s - I did have a brief interlude about like, 1357s - I think an interesting case where like 1359s - these kind of abstractions do break down even more. 1362s - And so I do have like a kind of a fun question. 1365s - Which is like, do the matrix contents 1367s - affect your matrix multiplication performance? 1370s - And so I think, you know, if you kind of like, 1373s - you know, are familiar with like, you know, 1375s - general performance, there are like a lot of things that... 1378s - A lot of ways where like data can impact your performance, 1380s - but in this case matmuls actually avoid a lot of them. 1383s - So for example, they have identical memory access patterns 1385s - regardless of like what data is in your tensor, 1388s - there\\'s like no control flow in the matmul. 1391s - And the GPU also don\\'t have like the denormals. 1393s - So like that\\'s like not a possibility as well. 1397s - So if you like, you know, 1398s - and in this case where like taking three tensors, 1400s - we\\'re initializing them with like all zeros. 1403s - Like a tensor initialized from the Gaussian distribution 1406s - and then a tensor initialized 1408s - from like a uniform distribution, 1409s - which is like from zero to one. 1410s - And so funnily enough, if you benchmark this, 1413s - you actually find that there is a performance difference 1416s - depending on the actual data that is within your tensors. 1421s - And so there\\'s this tweet from some of you guys might know, 1426s - a long time ago that really I think 1428s - like when I first saw this. 1429s - I actually was very much reminded of this tweet, 1432s - where, you know, I thought I knew how like a GPU worked, 1435s - but then I was like very confused about 1437s - what could possibly be causing 1439s - these like performance differences like, you know, 1441s - between the different data. 1443s - And so the actual cause here is something called 1446s - like leakage power or dynamic power where I think, you know, 1449s - most of you\\'re probably familiar that you know, 1452s - like when a CPU or GPU is under load, 1454s - it uses more like power 1456s - and at some point it can like throttle, you know, 1458s - it\\'s like using the maximum amount of power can use 1461s - or the max amount of like a heat it\\'s allowed. 1465s - But the actual thing is that like, you know, 1466s - this power doesn\\'t just like come from nowhere. 1469s - It actually largely comes from what\\'s called 1471s - like dynamic or switching power. 1474s - And what this means is like every time a transistor 1476s - like on the GPU switches from like zero to one 1479s - or like, you know, high to low or low to high, 1481s - it like loses a little bit of this power. 1484s - And so the actual like power usage on your GPU 1486s - is kind of like a like sum across the total amount 1489s - of like switching that goes on in your GPU. 1493s - And so this is why like if you\\'re multiplying 1495s - with all zeros, you can imagine 1496s - that like your GPU ends up not, 1498s - like a lot of transistors don\\'t end up switching at all. 1501s - And so like it doesn\\'t actually consume that much power 1503s - and it\\'s much less a throttle. 1506s - And so if you actually like look at this, 1509s - you can actually get like very different performance 1510s - for like all these different kind of fund distributions. 1513s - Like whether it\\'s like, you know, the normal distribution 1516s - or whether it\\'s like a checkerboard type like pattern 1519s - or you know, it\\'s like sparse or ternary. 1521s - And the reason why is just like, 1523s - it\\'s like this kind of abstract thing 1525s - where these different patterns lead to like more or less 1527s - transistor flips and which leads to like more or less 1531s - of power throttling, which leads to like more or less 1534s - of performance. 1535s - And so I remember actually one time somebody had told me 1538s - a funny story where like they were like training 1541s - the machine learning model and benchmarking performance. 1544s - And then they like at some point their model would nad, 1547s - and then they\\'d be like wow my performance 1549s - just got way better (chuckles). 1551s - And so I like wrote an article about this 1553s - and they like messaged me and they were like, oh you know, 1555s - that was very illustrative 1557s - because you know, I was really confused 1558s - why my performance would be getting better. 1560s - But that\\'s why, you know, like if all your tensors are NaN, 1563s - your transistors also don\\'t need to do a lot of flipping 1565s - and so you know, you\\'ll measure like a better perf. 1570s - So that\\'s kind of compute. 1571s - And so the next thing that your GPU can be spending 1574s - a lot of your time on is like memory, 1576s - which is essentially a time spent transferring your tensors 1579s - within a GPU. 1585s - And so I think one thing to observe 1587s - from this kind of empirical plot 1590s - from a paper on like a data movement is that although like, 1595s - so this paper kind of breaks down the operations 1598s - on like I think a Bert type model. 1601s - Into what it calls like tensor contractions, 1603s - i.e memory locations. 1605s - And then like, you know, normalization operations 1607s - and element wise operations. 1609s - And so you can see that although major (indistinct) 1612s - are responsible for like 99.8% of your FLOPS, 1615s - they\\'re only responsible for 61% of your runtime. 1618s - And so you know where like why are we spending like, 1621s - you know, 40% of our runtime doing like operations 1624s - like cumulatively only take 0.2% of our FLOPS? 1629s - The kind of a key thing here is what\\'s called 1632s - like a memory bandwidth cost. 1634s - Where the way I typically think about this, 1637s - is that like even like, and so here I\\'m talking like 1640s - all of your data already lives on the GPU, like, you know, 1642s - it\\'s like, you know, it\\'s like, you know, 1643s - occupying your like GPU\\'s VRAM. 1648s - But the thing is that like your GPU\\'s VRAM 1650s - is not where it like the compute units are located. 1654s - And in order to actually do operations on a GPU, 1656s - you need to move your data from like the VRAM 1659s - to like where the compute units are located, 1662s - which is like your SRAM or like compute units. 1665s - And so usually I kind of think this of like 1667s - as like a factory where you have like a factory 1669s - with like not that much space. 1671s - And then you have a warehouse located like much further away 1675s - and so you have like a lot more space in your warehouse, 1678s - but now in order to do any operations 1680s - like on those like supplies, 1683s - you need to move them from your warehouse 1685s - to your factory and then back. 1688s - And so this cost of like moving data around 1690s - is called the memory bandwidth cost. 1693s - And so this is actually like responsible 1695s - for like a lot of like what your GPU 1697s - is spending its time doing. 1699s - Where if you imagine like let\\'s say we do like, you know, 1701s - three operations like on a GPU, 1704s - so maybe you\\'re doing like an add, 1705s - and then like a, you know, RELU, 1707s - and then like a sign operation. 1710s - Like you can imagine that what actually happens 1712s - when you do these operations. 1713s - Like first the GPU sends the data from like the memory 1717s - to the compute units and then you know, 1719s - turns it from a square to a triangle 1720s - and then it sends it all the way back. 1722s - And then you know, it sends the triangle 1724s - from like the memory units to the compute units again 1727s - where it does like another operation 1728s - and then sends it all the way back. 1730s - And then finally, you know, you guys get the idea, 1731s - it\\'s like sending the circle from the memory units 1733s - to the compute units again 1734s - and then it\\'s like sending into all the way back. 1737s - And so by default whenever you run any operations 1739s - like in PyTorch like let\\'s say you ran like add 1741s - and then multiply and then cosine, 1743s - this is exactly what would be happening on our GPU. 1747s - And so you might think that this is a very like dumb thing 1749s - to do and you would be correct. 1753s - And that, you know, why are we like sending our triangle 1755s - back from like the factory to the warehouse 1758s - just to send the data from like the warehouse 1760s - back to the factory again. 1762s - And so a very like common operation for GPU compilers to do, 1767s - and I\\'d say what I\\'d actually call 1768s - like the most important optimization 1770s - in a deep learning compiler by far, 1772s - is called operator fusion. 1774s - And so what an operator fusion does is that instead of like, 1777s - you know, sending the data back and forth so much. 1779s - we like do a single GPU kernel where you send the data once 1783s - to the factory units, you do all of the operations 1787s - and then you send the data back. 1790s - Also, notably, this is also like an issue. 1794s - This optimization is not really something you can do 1795s - in eager mode, right? 1797s - Because in eager mode I was, you know, mentioning 1799s - like the executed model is very simple 1801s - where you like run our operation 1803s - and then it executes the operation. 1804s - And now if we want to do this optimization, 1807s - that program model is like no longer sufficient. 1811s - And so there\\'s actually like a lot of different ways 1813s - to minimize memory movement. 1815s - Although at the end of the day, 1816s - like operator fusion is like the most important thing 1819s - you can do for like a ML compiler. 1821s - There\\'s actually like a lot of decisions 1823s - that go into operator fusion that like kind of enable it 1826s - to be more or less effective. 1828s - One of the kind of examples here 1830s - is kind of these like re computation 1832s - versus reuse trade-offs. 1833s - If you guys are kind of familiar with maybe 1835s - like register allocation type settings, 1837s - you kind of often have a similar issue 1839s - where like if you have a register you can choose 1842s - to either like store it in global memory 1845s - and then load from it later, 1846s - or you can just choose to like recompute 1848s - that value from like values that are ready in the registers. 1852s - And so you kind of have a similar idea here 1855s - where you oftentimes have cases where by doing some amount 1859s - of re computation you can significantly reduce your memory. 1863s - You can significantly reduce your number of memory accesses. 1866s - And so in this way, like the recomputation 1869s - can not only like reduce your like peak memory usage, 1872s - it can also often like improve 1873s - your actual runtime performance. 1877s - And so I think one of the things 1880s - to mention actually about like why. 1882s - So this observation actually ends up being 1884s - like quite important for deep learning performance 1885s - like re computation versus reuse. 1887s - And I think the reason why is that like the shape 1890s - of machine learning programs, 1891s - actually I think it looks quite unusual 1893s - compared to like your typical program that you might have. 1896s - Where like it\\'s generally like a kind of a bit of an axiom 1900s - in like programs that usually most intermediates 1902s - that you have are very short-lived. 1904s - So like, you know, your program generally consists 1906s - of a lot of very short-lived intermediates 1907s - that you know are created 1908s - and they\\'re very shortly destroyed. 1911s - But in machine learning this is actually not the case. 1913s - Because in machine learning, like the typical like model 1916s - that you\\'ll execute will first like run the model 1919s - forward like, you know, layer zero to layer one, 1922s - to layer two, to layer three, to layer four, 1924s - and then initially run what\\'s called the backwards pass, 1926s - which will like run the layers in reverse. 1929s - So then it\\'ll go from like layer four to layer three, 1931s - to layer two, to layer one and to layer zero. 1934s - And in between the forward pass 1936s - and the backwards pass you need to save 1938s - what are called like intermediates or activations. 1941s - And so these are like a lot of, like, 1944s - you have a lot of them. 1945s - And they\\'re like often times like, you know, 1947s - largely responsible for like running into 1950s - like out of memory type errors. 1952s - And so I think this is actually 1953s - like kind of a pretty unusual like program structure 1957s - in machine learning that\\'s caused like, you know, 1960s - back propagation and gradient dissent. 1965s - And so finally, you know, the last thing 1967s - you can be spending your time on is overhead. 1969s - Where you can imagine that, 1970s - you know, if a poor Gromit is not able 1973s - to put down the train tracks faster than the train 1975s - can like go on the train tracks, 1977s - then sometimes a train is gonna be just stuck 1980s - waiting for him to put down like the next train track. 1982s - And so here I have like a profile trace 1985s - where you can see that like the bottom line, 1987s - which is a GPU trace is largely idle 1990s - and it\\'s mostly just idle waiting for the CPU 1992s - to like schedule the next operation. 1996s - And so there are a lot of like ways 1997s - to actually address this nowadays. 1999s - One of the most powerful is called CUDAgraphs, 2001s - which is like an NVIDIA provided API, 2004s - but you also have like other approaches like in a compiler 2006s - for example, like codegenning like a lower overhead wrapper 2009s - or something like this. 2017s - So you know, I\\'ve talked about like ML compilers like, 2021s - and you know like you know what they can do to your program 2023s - and how they can be useful. 2024s - But I think kind of like an interesting question 2027s - that you often see like, you know, I talked a lot about 2029s - how like, you know, we have like, you know, 2032s - super massive infra build out 2034s - and the programs are super simple. 2035s - And we\\'ve seen like a lot of consolidation 2037s - in terms of like what the architecture looks like. 2040s - And so I think like a reasonable question is like, 2042s - if you only have like one architecture 2043s - and you\\'re spending like billions of dollars to train it, 2046s - why do you even need a compiler? 2049s - You know, like why can\\'t you just like, you know, 2050s - assign some group of people to like optimize it by hand 2053s - instead of like a leveraging a compiler? 2058s - And I\\'m gonna say some like kind of or sorry, 2062s - and the other thing I\\'ll say about this 2065s - actually is that like in practice a lot of times 2068s - people do not use compilers like for kind of this reason. 2072s - And so this section is gonna be talking a little bit about 2074s - like why I think that\\'s a case. 2077s - And what are kind of some of the challenges 2079s - when it comes to like using compilers in this setting. 2083s - And yeah, so disclaimer, you know, 2084s - I do really like compilers. 2085s - I\\'m gonna say some kind of mean things about compilers 2088s - in a bit, but you know, as like to establish my credibility, 2094s - you know, I work on a team called Fighter\\'s Compilers. 2096s - And so there are like, to be clear like a lot of reasons 2098s - why compilers can be very useful. 2101s - In particular this kinda like notion of leverage, 2103s - like being able to do the optimization once in the compiler 2106s - and then having everybody be able to like take advantage 2108s - of it. 2110s - And also, you know, compilers are also just like very fun 2112s - to work on. 2114s - That being said, yeah, I\\'m gonna introduce you. 2117s - You know, my new exciting library, 2120s - Horace\\'s exciting library abbreviated at HEL. 2124s - And so it has a couple of cool features 2125s - that you might be interested in. 2127s - So the first feature it has is that it doesn\\'t always work. 2131s - And you know, to address that, 2133s - it also has no documentation about 2135s - why or when it will work except by reading my library 2138s - as an implementation. 2139s - And in exchange for that, when you update the library, 2142s - it may totally change what code works 2144s - and what code doesn\\'t work. 2145s - I.e. like no backwards compatibility or like guarantees 2149s - on your like, you know, on whether your code works. 2154s - And so are you interested in using my library? 2158s - I guess, you know, most people would probably say no. 2161s - And so I think one thing to note here 2163s - that like if work means like has a desired performance 2166s - and is applying the desired optimizations, 2168s - this is kind of largely describing 2170s - how compiler optimizations work. 2172s - And that compiled optimizations don\\'t always work. 2175s - Often like there\\'s no real documentation 2178s - on when a compiler optimization will trigger and you know, 2181s - when you update your compiler 2183s - it may completely change when it does 2186s - or does not apply these optimizations. 2190s - And so there\\'s like very influential article 2194s - like about this compiler called ISPC. 2197s - And they have this note here called auto vectorization 2199s - is not a programming model. 2201s - Where they note here is that like, you know, 2203s - the problem with an auto vectorizer, 2205s - which is kind of like a compiler... 2206s - Or so the overall like framing of the article 2208s - is that he wrote this compiler called like ISPC, 2211s - which you can think of as like CUDA 2213s - for intel SIMD instructions. 2216s - And he kind of, you know, is constantly like, you know, 2218s - as part of the article, he is constantly trying to fight 2220s - against like the intel compiler team, 2223s - which is like where he works. 2224s - With the intel compiler team, 2225s - wanted to kind of leverage auto vectorization 2228s - to get vectorization done 2229s - instead of introducing like a new program model in ISPC. 2233s - And so he kind of, I think elucidates like what the problem 2236s - with the auto vectoriser. 2238s - Which is that the problem with the auto vectoriser 2239s - is that as long as vectors can fail 2241s - and it will then if you\\'re programmer 2243s - that actually cares about what code the compiler 2245s - generates from your program, 2246s - you need to deeply understand the auto vectoriser. 2250s - Then when it fails to vectorize code, 2252s - you wanna be vectorized, you need 2254s - to either poke it in the right way 2255s - or change your program in the right way 2256s - so that it works for you again. 2258s - And so this is like a very horrible way to program. 2260s - And then, you know, if most of you are, 2262s - or if any of you here are like very like into using 2265s - SIMD instructions, you probably also do not trust 2267s - the auto vectorize at all and you\\'re mostly just, you know, 2269s - writing intrinsics. 2272s - And so the, you know, with the proper program model, 2276s - ideally the user is able to like learn what does 2279s - and does not work without, you know, needing to be tied 2282s - to the implementation and then, you know, 2284s - one compiler implements it 2285s - and then the user can like learn to reliably rely 2287s - on this optimization without needing to understand 2290s - the compiler and only needing to understand 2292s - the programming model. 2294s - And so one I guess way you can phrase this 2296s - is that like a compiler optimization 2298s - that always works is just part of the programming model. 2301s - Like for example, when you\\'re writing like, you know, 2303s - SIMD instructions, you know that as SIMD intrinsic 2307s - will always get mapped to SIMD instruction. 2309s - And so that\\'s like part of your program model 2311s - and not really an optimization that the compiler is doing. 2316s - So I think, you know, to... 2319s - Like when I see like the people kind of complaining 2322s - about like Shoggoths and working with them, 2325s - I kind of am often reminded times of a compiler. 2328s - We can imagine that like a compiler is oftentimes 2330s - it\\'s like large piece of code that you know 2333s - has been worked on by a lot of like very smart people 2335s - and oftentimes has a lot of like tricky details 2338s - and implementation details in it. 2341s - And so ideally when you\\'re doing a compiler, 2343s - like only the program model ends up being exposed 2345s - to the user. 2346s - So like the actual compiler implementation 2347s - ends up being completely hidden. 2349s - And so the user only needs to deal 2350s - with like the nice program model, 2351s - but it\\'s usually just like the language 2353s - that the compiler is compiling from. 2361s - Unfortunately, you know, when compilers fail 2363s - and like, you know, they don\\'t apply the optimizations 2365s - that you want them to apply. 2366s - The kind of entire thing becomes exposed. 2369s - And so, you know, this kind of applies anytime 2371s - that you\\'re like you\\'re wrestling with a compiler 2373s - and you\\'re trying to understand why the compiler 2375s - like did or did not like inline my code or things like this. 2381s - And so to give some examples of like cases 2382s - where like very kind of nuanced details here. 2386s - Can lead to compilers like having, 2388s - like it can lead to compilers struggling a lot. 2390s - One of them here is like numerics and machine learning. 2393s - Where numerics can be like a kind of a, 2395s - or like in general floating point, 2397s - like arithmetic is like a very cursed thing 2399s - to deal with generally speaking. 2401s - And it\\'s just gotten even worse with the fact 2405s - that like everybody in the industry 2406s - keeps on pushing our data types lower 2408s - to lower and lower bits where like on the V100 2411s - they kind of introduce like 16 bit operations 2414s - is kind of the default. 2415s - And on H100 they introduced eight bit operations 2418s - and on the B100, you know, they\\'re now pushing 2420s - for like four bit operation, like four bit floats. 2423s - And operations on four bit floating point numbers. 2425s - I think it\\'s reasonable to question like 2428s - how is this even a floating point number at this point? 2431s - But this is kind of what we\\'re typically dealing with. 2436s - And so as a result of like this kind of like low precision 2438s - and the fact that numerics end up being so subtle, 2440s - the algorithms have like very annoying numerical problems 2443s - to deal with. 2443s - And I think a good example for me 2445s - that was like very frustrating was this kind of a NaN 2448s - in like a FlashAttention implementation. 2450s - Where the underlying cause here is something called an FMA 2453s - or like a fuse multiply accumulate. 2455s - It can actually be like disastrously bad 2458s - when it comes to your numerics. 2461s - So for folks who are unfamiliar with FMA, 2463s - it\\'s basically like it takes like A, B and C 2465s - and it does like a signal operation 2467s - that does A times B plus C. 2470s - And so one of the ways that FMA differs 2472s - from normal operations is that in addition to being faster, 2476s - it\\'s also usually computed 2478s - in what people call like infinite precision internally.']"
