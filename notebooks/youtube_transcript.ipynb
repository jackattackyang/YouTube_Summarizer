      "526.32s - just goes into like making\n",
      "your like models hit\n",
      "530.07s - like this, like very high perf barrier.\n",
      "534.75s - Another ind of a interesting observation\n",
      "537.48s - in like machine learning is that,\n",
      "539.76s - that has kind of exacerbated this a bit.\n",
      "541.95s - Is that the field has\n",
      "consolidated significantly\n",
      "544.05s - over the last five to 10 years.\n",
      "546.57s - So one of them is that like, you know,\n",
      "548.25s - like maybe 10 years ago you had\n",
      "like a lot more architecture\n",
      "551.04s - is a lot more variance\n",
      "and like different things\n",
      "552.69s - that people were trying.\n",
      "554.07s - But nowadays people really\n",
      "just like transformers are like\n",
      "557.61s - the dominant architecture for everything.\n",
      "558.96s - Like you have transformers for\n",
      "vision, you have transformers\n",
      "560.94s - for language, you have\n",
      "transformers for like, you know,\n",
      "563.25s - audio, it's kind of like all transformers.\n",
      "566.46s - And the other way like\n",
      "things have kind of changed\n",
      "568.47s - is that instead of like, you\n",
      "know, many different people\n",
      "571.5s - training SOTA models.\n",
      "572.88s - You oftentimes just have a few companies\n",
      "574.89s - that are training SOTA models.\n",
      "576.42s - And so we've kind of gone\n",
      "from a bit of like a monopoly\n",
      "578.82s - where like, you know,\n",
      "previously there was this like,\n",
      "581.271s - you know, one person providing the infra\n",
      "582.57s - and like many people using the infra,\n",
      "584.7s - to in some ways it feels a\n",

      "588.06s - where you have like many\n",

      "597.015s - And so as a kind of\n",

      "general ways to think about\n",
      "602.46s - like getting performance\n",
      "from like your systems.\n",
      "605.73s - And so one of the ways\n",
      "generally is basically\n",
      "607.95s - like optimizations is\n",
      "like you have a compiler,\n",
      "609.9s - you like make the\n",
      "compiler faster, you know,\n",
      "612.57s - you improve like the performance\n",
      "613.86s - of everybody using your compiler.\n",
      "616.692s - and so the other way though\n",
      "617.525s - is kind of like programming models.\n",
      "619.89s - And so like this is kind of analogous\n",
      "621.27s - as opposed to like a\n",
      "system whose responsibility\n",
      "623.97s - is to like chop down a tree\n",
      "625.56s - and then you know, you're\n",
      "just like optimizing\n",
      "627.09s - how fast you can chop down the tree.\n",
      "628.86s - And the other alternative is\n",
      "like you're providing tools\n",
      "631.17s - for people to cut down\n",
      "the trees themselves.\n",
      "635.13s - And so to kind of like talk a little bit\n",
      "636.72s - about programming models, I\n",
      "think it's like illustrative\n",
      "640.44s - to kind of talk about\n",
      "how like ML frameworks\n",
      "642.42s - have kind of evolved in\n",
      "terms of what program model\n",
      "644.82s - they've exposed to users.\n",
      "647.04s - So originally like I think like 2010,\n",
      "651.23s - like 2011, 2012, the\n",
      "first like ML framework\n",
      "654.15s - that kind of got a lot of\n",
      "popularity was this framework\n",
      "656.19s - called Caffe.\n",
      "657.33s - And the way you like express\n",
      "neural networks in Caffe\n",
      "659.46s - is like a very declarative nature.\n",
      "662.04s - And by that I mean you like\n",
      "edited a protobuf file I think.\n",
      "665.88s - Where like the protobuf like\n",
      "specified all the things\n",
      "668.04s - you needed like care\n",
      "about your neural network.\n",
      "671.25s - And so as you can imagine, you know,\n",
      "672.42s - programming protobufs is\n",
      "like not very fun, you know,\n",
      "674.82s - there's a lot of things\n",
      "you might want to do\n",
      "677.011s - that you can't do in protobufs.\n",
      "678.36s - and so a like natural\n",
      "net thing that people did\n",
      "681.3s - was kind of these kind of\n",
      "graph builder type APIs.\n",
      "684.15s - And so this is kind of,\n",
      "you know, how TensorFlow 1\n",
      "686.19s - kinda of look like where the\n",
      "idea is that oh, you know,\n",
      "688.59s - like programming like, you\n",
      "know, programming protobufs\n",
      "691.26s - or like no human should need\n",
      "to write protobufs by hand.\n",
      "694.38s - And so ideally, you know,\n",
      "695.73s - you should just like\n",
      "write like a DSL of sorts\n",
      "698.61s - that allows you to generate the protobufs\n",
      "700.74s - like from this DSL.\n",
      "703.47s - However, like even this\n",
      "DSL still kind of has\n",
      "706.02s - like a lot of confusion in it.\n",
      "708.18s - Like it is not super clear\n",
      "that like given this DSL\n",
      "710.31s - like how code actually\n",
      "executes on your GPU.\n",
      "714.06s - And so kind of finally\n",
      "like around 2016 or 2017,\n",
      "717.78s - PyTorch started to become\n",
      "like really successful.\n",
      "720.06s - And kind of the like the feature\n",
      "722.7s - that like was most emblematic\n",
      "of PyTorch was basically\n",
      "726.33s - what was called imperative\n",
      "or eager execution.\n",
      "728.73s - And so what this means is that like,\n",
      "733.86s - or like, yeah, so PyTorch\n",
      "you know, was very successful\n",
      "736.29s - and I think it's like worth talking about\n",
      "737.46s - like why eager execution\n",
      "was so successful.\n",
      "740.31s - And I think that the main\n",
      "reason it was successful,\n",
      "742.05s - it just comes down to like\n",
      "what the programming model\n",
      "744.24s - of the execution looked like.\n",
      "745.6s - Where in a imperative\n",
      "slash like eager execution\n",
      "748.35s - is basically like, you\n",
      "know, you call a function,\n",
      "750.96s - the GPU runs a function\n",
      "752.73s - and then the function finishes\n",
      "and you know, that's it.\n",
      "755.656s - Like, you know, like that's\n",
      "basically all you do.\n",
      "757.35s - you call like torch.matmul\n",
      "and this is basically\n",
      "759.54s - the sequence of operations\n",
      "that happens but you know,\n",
      "762.51s - with kind of like a\n",
      "graph mode type approach\n",
      "765.06s - or you know, where kind\n",
      "of this pilot interjects.\n",
      "767.4s - You first like define the function,\n",
      "769.29s - the function gets converted\n",
      "into some like intermediate IR,\n",
      "772.552s - you know, a bunch of who knows\n",
      "what happens to your function\n",
      "775.86s - and then eventually like the\n",
      "function eventually executes\n",
      "778.53s - on the GPU.\n",
      "780.39s - And like the top one\n",
      "was like a very simple\n",
      "783.6s - execution model for people to understand.\n",
      "786.81s - And I think another thing\n",
      "that's kind of interesting\n",
      "788.58s - to notice about this is\n",
      "that this kind of also just,\n",
      "791.28s - like the top half also kind of describes\n",
      "793.83s - how Python executes.\n",
      "796.56s - And I think this is kind of\n",
      "a pretty illustrative to me\n",
      "798.81s - of like why Python has been so successful\n",
      "801.11s - in machine learning.\n",
      "802.62s - It's basically that like,\n",
      "like a funny statement\n",
      "806.31s - that you can make about Python\n",
      "is that like if you tried\n",
      "808.95s - to like train a model\n",
      "today, like you know,\n",
      "812.25s - I gave you like a day\n",
      "to like train a model,\n",
      "814.68s - it would run faster if\n",
      "you ran it in Python\n",
      "816.51s - compared to doing in C++.\n",
      "818.67s - And you might argue that this\n",
      "is like a unfair comparison.\n",
      "822.78s - Because you know, like you\n",
      "know all the infra like,\n",
      "824.947s - you know, all the\n",
      "frameworks that people built\n",
      "825.9s - are in Python.\n",
      "827.25s - But I think the reason why so many\n",
      "828.78s - of these frameworks have\n",
      "been built in Python\n",
      "830.67s - is that Python is like an exceedingly like\n",
      "833.31s - a simple language.\n",
      "834.63s - And so it's also like\n",
      "a very global language.\n",
      "837.78s - And what I mean by like global\n",
      "is that like it's very easy\n",
      "840.39s - for people to build\n",
      "their own infrastructure\n",
      "842.04s - on top of Python without\n",
      "really needing to fight\n",
      "844.68s - with like anything the\n",
      "Python language does\n",
      "846.93s - because the Python language\n",
      "itself does basically nothing.\n",
      "851.175s - Like it, you know, it doesn't\n",
      "do any optimizations for you.\n",
      "853.38s - It just like, you know, takes\n",
      "your function and runs it.\n",
      "856.98s - And so I think that PyTorch\n",
      "basically historically\n",
      "859.83s - is at like a very similar\n",
      "point in the design space.\n",
      "862.86s - Where PyTorch is like execution\n",
      "model is like so very simple\n",
      "867.93s - and although this like\n",
      "doesn't really give you a lot\n",
      "870.3s - in terms of like, it\n",
      "doesn't like automatically\n",
      "871.95s - do a lot of things for you, it\n",
      "does mean that it's very easy\n",
      "874.71s - for people to like build\n",
      "their own infrastructure\n",
      "878.37s - and frameworks on top of PyTorch.\n",
      "886.523s - I think another important\n",
      "detail to realize\n",
      "890.16s - especially about like PyTorch\n",
      "when it first came out.\n",
      "892.62s - Is that like this kind\n",
      "of unoptimized execution\n",
      "895.74s - didn't actually even sacrifice\n",
      "any performance at all.\n",
      "899.07s - Like, you know when\n",
      "people kind of benchmarked\n",
      "900.45s - PyTorch versus like, you\n",
      "know, TensorFlow at Cafe,\n",
      "903.03s - PyTorch oftentimes wasn't even\n",
      "slower than those frameworks.\n",
      "907.08s - And I think there's like a\n",
      "two main reasons for this.\n",
      "909.45s - So the first reason is\n",
      "that back in the day,\n",
      "911.85s - like you know about like\n",
      "90% plus of your time\n",
      "914.04s - was spent in matmuls.\n",
      "915.3s - And so there's basically nothing\n",
      "else you need to optimize.\n",
      "917.7s - And so matmuls here are\n",
      "like matrix implications\n",
      "920.1s - and so they're often provided\n",
      "by these like vendor libraries\n",
      "922.44s - like cuBLAS or like QDNN.\n",
      "925.289s - And like you know, they're\n",
      "provided by NVIDIA.\n",
      "926.76s - and they're like very hand optimized\n",
      "928.65s - and so, you know, if 90% of\n",
      "your time is spent in matmuls,\n",
      "931.65s - then like what else can you\n",
      "even do to like optimize\n",
      "934.2s - the performance of your neural network?\n",
      "937.92s - And I think another\n",
      "kind of interesting like\n",
      "942.87s - important piece here for like\n",
      "why PyTorch's performance\n",
      "945.15s - was like quite good is\n",
      "that it had this like\n",
      "947.37s - Async execution model.\n",
      "949.5s - Where basically the idea here\n",
      "is that like you kind of have\n",
      "952.23s - like a parallel work queue on your GPU.\n",
      "954.93s - And so what the CPU does is\n",
      "that it's only responsible\n",
      "957.84s - for scheduling work on your work queue\n",
      "959.91s - and then you know, the GPU\n",
      "executes work from the work queue\n",
      "963.36s - and I think of it\n",
      "generally as like this GIF\n",
      "966.21s - is what usually comes to mind\n",
      "and basically you can imagine\n",
      "968.76s - that like the dog is like,\n",
      "970.98s - or Gromit is like Python, you\n",
      "know, they're like, you know,\n",
      "973.56s - trying to put down the train\n",
      "track in front of the train,\n",
      "976.14s - which is the GPU.\n",
      "977.49s - And so, you know, as long\n",
      "as like Gromit is able\n",
      "980.49s - to put down the train\n",
      "tracks faster than the train\n",
      "983.01s - actually rolls along the train tracks,\n",
      "985.11s - you can actually kind of view Python\n",
      "986.88s - as like having zero overhead.\n",
      "988.86s - Like it doesn't provide\n",
      "any extra cost compared to,\n",
      "992.61s - you know, if Python was like\n",
      "in a more efficient language\n",
      "994.68s - like C++.\n",
      "997.65s - And so in this way like you know,\n",
      "999.167s - eager execution not only\n",
      "had like a much easier\n",
      "1001.7s - to understand program model for users,\n",
      "1003.68s - it was also like basically just as fast\n",
      "1006.62s - as like non eager execution.\n",
      "1010.4s - Unfortunately, you know,\n",
      "good things that never last.\n",
      "1013.19s - And in 2017 like NVIDIA introduced\n",

      "1018.67s - And if you guys are\n",

      "hardware units on the GPUs\n",
      "1023.96s - that only do matmul operations.\n",
      "1026.15s - Like, and I don't mean this\n",
      "like figuratively in the sense\n",
      "1029.87s - that like people often\n",
      "say that GPUs are like\n",
      "1031.49s - well suited for matmuls.\n",
      "1033.05s - I mean this like very literally\n",
      "1034.85s - in that like there's actually\n",
      "an assembly instruction\n",
      "1036.77s - that just does like a mini matmul.\n",
      "1038.99s - And this is how you like\n",

      "1041.84s - And so if you look at this\n",

      "versus non-matmul flops,\n",
      "1048.14s - you can really see like\n",
      "when NVIDIA realized\n",
      "1051.71s - that like deep learning was a big deal.\n",
      "1053.93s - Because like all, all\n",
      "of a sudden, you know,\n",
      "1055.46s - you kind of had this\n",
      "like massive like 10x gap\n",
      "1057.89s - and so there's like a log scale.\n",
      "1059.57s - And you had this kinda\n",

      "1073.19s - that like, you know, matmuls\n",
      "took like 90% of the time\n",

      "everything else like stayed\n",
      "1081.74s - the same amount of speed,\n",
      "1083.0s - then all of a sudden, you\n",
      "know, like you're spending\n",
      "1085.88s - a lot more of your time doing\n",
      "like non-matmul operations.\n",
      "1090.41s - And so as a result we've kind\n",

      "1464.87s - But the actual thing\n",
      "is that like, you know,\n",
      "1466.19s - this power doesn't just\n",
      "like come from nowhere.\n",
      "1469.43s - It actually largely\n",
      "comes from what's called\n",
      "1471.47s - like dynamic or switching power.\n",
      "1473.87s - And what this means is like\n",
      "every time a transistor\n",
      "1476.21s - like on the GPU switches\n",
      "from like zero to one\n",
      "1479.03s - or like, you know, high\n",
      "to low or low to high,\n",
      "1481.16s - it like loses a little bit of this power.\n",
      "1483.89s - And so the actual like\n",
      "power usage on your GPU\n",
      "1486.35s - is kind of like a like sum\n",
      "across the total amount\n",
      "1489.35s - of like switching that\n",
      "goes on in your GPU.\n",
      "1493.37s - And so this is why like\n",

      "don't end up switching at all.\n",
      "1500.63s - And so like it doesn't actually\n",
      "consume that much power\n",
      "1503.12s - and it's much less a throttle.\n",
      "1505.64s - And so if you actually like look at this,\n",
      "1508.64s - you can actually get like\n",
      "very different performance\n",
      "1510.44s - for like all these different\n",

      "1512.84s - Like whether it's like, you\n",

      "1516.17s - or whether it's like a\n",
      "checkerboard type like pattern\n",
      "1518.87s - or you know, it's like sparse or ternary.\n",
      "1520.88s - And the reason why is just like,\n",
      "1522.56s - it's like this kind of abstract thing\n",
      "1525.02s - where these different patterns\n",
      "lead to like more or less\n",

      "1533.86s - of performance.\n",
      "1535.28s - And so I remember actually\n",
      "one time somebody had told me\n",
      "1538.19s - a funny story where like\n",

      "1541.13s - the machine learning model\n",

      "1543.5s - And then they like at some\n",

      "1547.16s - and then they'd be like wow my performance\n",
      "1548.63s - just got way better (chuckles).\n",
      "1550.82s - And so I like wrote an article about this\n",
      "1553.1s - and they like messaged me and\n",
      "they were like, oh you know,\n",
      "1554.81s - that was very illustrative\n",
      "1557.27s - because you know, I was really confused\n",
      "1558.29s - why my performance\n",

      "measure like a better perf.\n",
      "1569.99s - So that's kind of compute.\n",
      "1571.37s - And so the next thing that\n",

      "1908.45s - and they're very shortly destroyed.\n",
      "1910.61s - But in machine learning this\n",
      "is actually not the case.\n",
      "1913.34s - Because in machine learning,\n",
      "like the typical like model\n",
      "1916.34s - that you'll execute will\n",
      "first like run the model\n",
      "1919.4s - forward like, you know,\n",
      "layer zero to layer one,\n",
      "1921.59s - to layer two, to layer\n",
      "three, to layer four,\n",
      "1923.84s - and then initially run what's\n",
      "called the backwards pass,\n",
      "1926.39s - which will like run the layers in reverse.\n",
      "1929.27s - So then it'll go from like\n",
      "layer four to layer three,\n",
      "1931.19s - to layer two, to layer\n",
      "one and to layer zero.\n",
      "1933.74s - And in between the forward pass\n",
      "1935.6s - and the backwards pass you need to save\n",
      "1937.58s - what are called like\n",
      "intermediates or activations.\n",
      "1940.97s - And so these are like a lot of, like,\n",

      "1953.39s - like kind of a pretty unusual\n",
      "like program structure\n",
      "1957.2s - in machine learning that's\n",
      "caused like, you know,\n",
      "1959.6s - back propagation and gradient dissent.\n",
      "1965.42s - And so finally, you know, the last thing\n",
      "1966.83s - you can be spending your\n",

      "1969.23s - Where you can imagine that,\n",
      "1970.1s - you know, if a poor Gromit is not able\n",

      "1975.44s - can like go on the train tracks,\n",

      "idle waiting for the CPU\n",
      "1992.12s - to like schedule the next operation.\n",

      "1998.69s - One of the most powerful\n",
      "is called CUDAgraphs,\n",
      "2000.91s - which is like an NVIDIA provided API,\n",

      "2009.25s - or something like this.\n",
      "2016.922s - So you know, I've talked\n",

      "architecture looks like.\n",
      "2039.58s - And so I think like a\n",
      "reasonable question is like,\n",
      "2041.83s - if you only have like one architecture\n",

      "2093.685s - you know, I work on a team\n",
      "called Fighter's Compilers.\n",

      "2100.57s - In particular this kinda\n",

      "able to like take advantage\n",

      "2133.15s - it also has no documentation about\n",

      "3236.16s - is that traditional distributed systems\n",
      "3237.99s - are oftentimes are just\n",
      "trying to scale a QPS.\n",
      "3240.87s - And so when you're like\n",
      "trying to scale QPS,\n",
      "3242.367s - you have a lot of like very\n",
      "small interchangeable queries\n",
      "3245.61s - and like the performance per hardware\n",
      "3247.35s - is not like that critical.\n",
      "3249.57s - And then oftentimes you're\n",
      "willing to like double\n",
      "3251.31s - your amount of hardware use\n",
      "3252.69s - in order to get like fall tolerance\n",
      "3254.28s - or like, you know, like higher\n",
      "uptime or things like this.\n",
      "3257.37s - On the other hand, in ML systems,\n",
      "3259.92s - we just basically have\n",
      "like a single query.\n",
      "3262.26s - Like, you know, you're just\n",
      "like training your ML job.\n",
      "3264.78s - We have frequent global synchronizations\n",
      "3266.58s - across all of our hardware and performance\n",
      "3270.18s - is like extremely important,\n",
      "3271.26s - you know, so much so\n",
      "that like there's no way\n",
      "3273.0s - we could tolerate like\n",
      "a 2x loss in performance\n",
      "3276.18s - for basically any reason.\n",
      "3280.92s - And so one way to kind of think about\n",
      "3282.93s - how you can paralyze programs.\n",
      "3284.79s - And this is actually\n",
      "like not specific to ML,\n",
      "3286.71s - this is kind of a general,\n",
      "3287.88s - like a way to think about\n",
      "paralyzing programs.\n",
      "3290.13s - Is that you can think\n",
      "that there's basically a,\n",
      "3292.05s - like you have like this\n",
      "cube of computation to do.\n",
      "3296.01s - Where one of the dimensions\n",
      "is like the batch dimension.\n",
      "3300.45s - So it's like different\n",
      "tasks that you can perform.\n",
      "3303.06s - You also have like the\n",
      "within task dimension,\n",
      "3305.34s - so like the different\n",
      "operations within a single task.\n",
      "3308.4s - And then finally you have\n",
      "like the time dimension,\n",
      "3310.59s - which is what your GPU is doing\n",
      "at any given point in time.\n",
      "3316.11s - And so you can think of data parallelism\n",
      "3317.34s - as basically just splitting\n",
      "along like the batch dimension.\n",
      "3320.61s - You can think about like task parallelism\n",
      "3322.35s - as splitting across a task dimension.\n",
      "3324.51s - And then you think about\n",
      "pipeline parallelism\n",
      "3325.77s - as kind of like splitting\n",
      "across the time dimension.\n",
      "3331.38s - Yeah, and so for data parallelism,\n",
      "3333.93s - like the basic idea I think\n",
      "is like pretty simple,\n",
      "3336.57s - which is just that we have like\n",
      "a bunch of different tasks.\n",
      "3338.76s - We have a bunch of parallelism,\n",
      "3340.17s - and so each GPU just\n",
      "handles a different task.\n",
      "3342.99s - And so because of that\n",
      "we just have like...\n",
      "3345.56s - We just put one task on\n",
      "each GPU and then run it.\n",
      "3348.48s - And this seems like very\n",
      "nice and very trivial,\n",
      "3351.0s - but the issue is that like we\n",
      "have a massive synchronization\n",
      "3353.52s - of parameters after every step.\n",
      "3355.62s - Because after every step\n",
      "that we do like the gradients\n",
      "3359.43s - need to be like synchronized\n",

      "3363.06s - And you can't just like\n",
      "avoid synchronizing\n",
      "3366.63s - your parameters because you\n",
      "also have this kind of like,\n",
      "3371.37s - mathy constraint from\n",
      "like the ML training side,\n",
      "3374.49s - which is that you simply can't\n",
      "train with like too large\n",
      "3376.56s - of a batch size or your model\n",
      "will not converge properly.\n",
      "3382.5s - There's also kind of another detail here\n",
      "3384.33s - where like you can't just like naively\n",
      "3385.74s - replicate your parameters.\n",
      "3387.21s - People oftentimes use like what's called\n",
      "3389.28s - a Fully-Sharded Data Parallel.\n",
      "3393.21s - The second kind of parallelism\n",
      "3394.043s - that you have is like task parallelism,\n",
      "3396.27s - which is commonly known\n",
      "as tensor parallelism.\n",
      "3398.22s - And in this case you\n",
      "basically just have two GPUs\n",
      "3400.26s - that split the same task.\n",
      "3402.06s - And so the main problem\n",
      "that you run into here\n",
      "3403.83s - that's kind of specific to ML\n",
      "is that like task parallelism\n",
      "3407.1s - because you're like running the same task\n",
      "3409.08s - does not oftentimes have like obvious ways\n",
      "3411.84s - to overlap your communication\n",
      "with your computation.\n",
      "3415.26s - But nevertheless, because the\n",
      "performance is so important,\n",
      "3418.2s - we still really want to\n",
      "overlap the communication.\n",
      "3420.87s - And so there ends up being like a lot\n",
      "3422.16s - of kind of involved things that people do\n",
      "3424.86s - to try to improve the overlap.\n",
      "3427.02s - One of them here is called\n",
      "like Async Tensor Parallelism.\n",
      "3430.2s - Where the general idea here\n",

      "3433.05s - followed by like a computation operation.\n",
      "3435.27s - And so usually, you know,\n",
      "3436.17s - while you're doing the communication,\n",
      "3437.82s - the CPU can't do any computation\n",
      "3439.71s - and so this is like, you know,\n",

      "3444.06s - But the observation here\n",
      "about Async Tensor Parallelism\n",
      "3446.84s - is you can actually kind\n",
      "of like mini pipeline\n",
      "3449.82s - your like communication and your matmul.\n",
      "3452.52s - Where even within like a\n",
      "single tensor operation,\n",
      "3455.4s - there's still oftentimes\n",
      "like a batch dimension\n",
      "3457.8s - that you can paralyze along.\n",
      "3459.36s - And so by like doing this\n",
      "kinda like micro pipelining\n",

You're going to have to wait for that then. It's a bird. It's a plane. No, it's a drone hovering over new Jersey. But in reality, it's probably a plane. It's Monday, December 16th. Let's ride. The holiday season is full of heartwarming stories of generosity and giving back. And I got another one for you right here last week. The extremely popular author James Patterson handed out $500 holiday bonuses to 600 employees at independent bookstores across the country. It's a tradition he started in 2015, inviting thousands of booksellers to apply and picking hundreds of winners from the nominees. In a statement, Patterson said booksellers save lives, period. I'm happy to be able to acknowledge them and all their hard work this holiday season. I mean, it does warm the heart. James Patterson is also a juggernaut. He sold more than 425 million copies of his book. His total income over the last decade is estimated at $700 million. That being said, his books have been described as a literary equivalent of Kentucky Fried Chicken, and he's often been criticized for coauthoring a lot of his stories. But a lot of people enjoy Kentucky Fried Chicken Meal, and it means some of his profits go towards these independent booksellers. Sometimes you just have to tip your cap and say, that is a good deed. Now, a word from our sponsor, the Range Rover Sport. That's right Neil, we're finishing off the year in style. Style is a great word for it because the new Range Rover Sport oozes class. Each model offers a sophisticated take on sporting luxury, so you can cruise in style but also get a little adventurous with its off roading capabilities. It's a dual threat Neal focused on road performance, but with world famous off road capability. It's the fire and ice of cars. The Toby and Neil of cars. Okay, but who's the off road power and who's the on road cruising? I think you're giving some off road vibes these days. Could be the 5:00 shadow.

      "Today, America's top tech moguls are marching one by one to Mar a Lago, a pilgrimage they hope will repair a rocky relationship with president elect Trump and curry favor with the upcoming administration. Last week, it was Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim Cook making the trek from California to Palm Beach. Before Thanksgiving, it was Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and this week, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos will have dinner with Trump. Meanwhile, meta, Amazon and OpenAI Sam Altman are writing checks to Trump, with all three saying last week they would contribute $1 million to his inaugural fund. For some historical context, it is not unusual for CEOs to cozy up to an incoming administration. The white House sets policies that will have major impacts on their companies, and they want to make sure their interests are being heard. This has been going on for decades, but for the tech industry in particular, it is a striking reversal. Silicon Valley and Trump were no fans of each other during his first stint in the white House, and shortly thereafter. It's certainly a sign of the times that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who a few years ago had been a major Democratic supporter, said last week it was a time of great promise for our nation. Yeah. After keeping the Trump administration or the Trump campaign out a little bit of an arm's length during the campaign season, a lot of these CEOs are saying, you know what? I do not want to risk being on bad terms with Trump. Let's go speak with him face to face. Let's go to Mar and just see what he's about and see if we can create this relationship. The thing about some of these inaugural fund donations, too, is what it does is guarantee you some face time with Trump and Vance, because donors to the, inauguration fund do get invitation to inauguration ball access to a candlelit dinner with the Trumps. And then, they also have a access to reception with the cabinet picks. So what you are seeing is paying $1 million, saying, like, I do want to have more opportunities to have FaceTime with you. And also one thing about inaugural committees is that they are pretty low stakes in terms of donations. They are seen as a very normal thing for companies to do, to seek favor. There is a little bit of a guise of patriotism attached to it as well, without being seen as like overly partizan. So I wouldn't read too much into the fact that they're all donating exactly $1 million, because it does give you access to the events, and it is a rather normal thing to do to an incoming administration. I want to talk about one of these, tech moguls that is going to Mar this week, Jeff Bezos, because I think he is a good example of what can happen when the relationship with the president goes sour. During the first administration, Trump's first administration, he repeatedly bashed Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, for negative coverage. And that did translate to the business world. You know, Amazon contends that they lost out on a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the federal government to Microsoft because Trump did not like Bezos. So that was a big business impact, for Amazon because of that rocky relationship. So now you're seeing Bezos make the trek to Mar He moved to South Florida. Reportedly, he's become friends with Jared and Ivanka down there, and he's hoping to make them not make amends because he probably thinks he didn't do anything wrong. But, trying to trying to reestablish that relationship because the one thing all these guys have in common is they're catching up to Elon Musk. Elon Musk already has that bromance with Trump, and there is the potential that Trump or Elon Musk could use that power to cut them out of lucrative business deals. Right. He is the other power player that CEOs are also trying to figure out how to navigate the relationship, because a lot of those CEOs could be wary that Musk could just punish his business rivals, could push them to the side. Sam Altman is obviously a big one of those. Elon Musk has repeatedly sued OpenAI, saying that it for so, or it went back on its promise to be this, open company. And it now is a for profit entity. Altman has said that he hopes or he thinks Elon will do the right thing because he said it would be, quote, profoundly un that Elon has it to hurt your competitors and advantage your own businesses. So, I mean, that is that could be a very optimistic look at the situation. But, the reality is that Elon now has a ton of power in the administration. He could wield it one way or the other. And CEOs are trying to figure out how to navigate him as well as navigate Donald Trump. There is a new entrant into the 13 figure club.\n",

      "Chipmaker Broadcom. Pull up a chair to sit at the $1 trillion market cap table just before the weekend. After reporting a breakout fourth quarter earnings, the stock jumped 24% to creep into uncharted territory and is now doubled in value this year. Unsurprisingly, it's been AI that has pushed Broadcom into the big leagues. It supplies advanced AI hardware to big tech companies much like Nvidia, but also has a robust software business as well. AI revenue is up 220% this year. And it's got to the point that when Broadcom does well, shares of Nvidia and competitors like AMD shrink on fears that incumbent AI stalwarts could lose market share to the surging Broadcom. Looking forward, the company's CEO, Hock Tan, expects its AI opportunity to reach $90 billion by 2027, powered by what it calls Hyperscaler customers, which are those companies like Meta and Google that require large scale data centers? You know, Broadcom is not a name that a lot of people know off the top of their heads, but they will soon. The last time I will say I thought about Broadcom was six years ago in 2018. And that was when Broadcom tried to buy Qualcomm for $120 billion. It would be one of the biggest, if not the biggest tech acquisitions of all time. Trump speaking of Trump, he blocked that deal from going forward because at the time Broadcom was based in Singapore and it was blocked over national security concerns. Turns out Broadcom did not name Qualcomm at all. Since 2018, Broadcom shares are up 760%. Qualcomm's up 165% and the S&P 500 is up 119%. So Broadcom easily outpacing the other guys. And that's really because of this AI revolution with ChatGPT in 2022 sales of its AI chips are up a lot. Sales of its non AI chips are down. So without AI Broadcom is probably looking more like Qualcomm. And now it's in the $1 trillion club. That being said though, its CEO Hock Tan loves to take these big swings. I mean it tried to swing acquire Qualcomm for the biggest tech acquisition ever. But it's also recently bought VMware for $61 billion. VMware helps with, server virtualization. They also that VMware deal only trails Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard and Dell's, Dell purchase as the biggest tech deals ever. It also agreed to buy this software vendor in 2018. For $19 billion. It had another acquisition of a security company for $10 billion in 2019. So Hock Tan does like going on these shopping sprees. He does like to acquire as a means to grow Broadcom. But Broadcom is a little bit different than Nvidia in the sense that Nvidia sells GPUs. Graphic processing units. Broadcom calls its version of GPUs exposed, which are just slightly different. They are a little bit more advanced. These chips aren't for just your everyday company. They are only for the companies that really want to push to the edge of, efficiency and power. 20, 30% faster, 20, 30% less power. So you have to be a Google. You have to be a matter. You have to be a Microsoft to actually find use in that. But luckily those companies are spending very, very big on AI. And so Broadcom is in a pretty solid position right now. They're spending $59 billion in the last quarter alone. That's four companies alphabet Amazon meta and Microsoft spent $59 billion on capital expenditures. A lot of that is going to Nvidia. A lot of that is going to Broadcom. That's about 18% of their total revenue over the quarter. So a very concentrated group of customers. You know you ever talk about having a you know a very specialized customer base. They have you know, 3 or 4 customers. So it really the fortunes depend on whether these companies continue to spend or they pull back. And now it is $1 trillion. That is pretty crazy because you definitely haven't heard of Broadcom unless you're pretty plugged into maybe the chip industry. But now it is literally part of that 13 figure club. The rumor mill is still buzzing about the drones flying over\n",

      "new Jersey with more questions and answers emerging over the weekend. To recap, new Jersey residents have been bewildered over the past few weeks due to drones buzzing over their state. A U.S. Army research facility has reported 11 confirmed instances of drones illegally entering its airspace, while more than a dozen drones have been spotted over a US naval weapons station since early December. sightings have also been reported in six counties across the state, prompting US lawmakers to get more involved. US Senator Chuck Schumer called on the Department of Homeland Security to deploy a recently declassified tech that can ID and track drones back to their landing spots in an effort to get to the bottom of the sightings. As for what we do know, officials from Homeland Security say that the drones don't appear to be linked to foreign governments. While the FBI is pretty sure a lot of people have just been seeing planes, quote, many of the reported drone sightings are in fact, manned aircraft being misidentified as drones, they said in a statement. Either way, Neal, we're now multiple weeks into these sightings, and still no one has really gotten to the bottom of things. No. They have they don't know what's going on. This really dominated the Sunday talk shows yesterday. Everyone was talking about, I know you were busy watching Manchester City, Manchester United, but there are tons of lawmakers going on these shows talking about the drone issue. It is certainly raised to the national level because it's not just new Jersey, it's also Connecticut, New York and Maryland as well. On Friday night, they had to shut down Stewart International Airport, about 60 miles north of New York City, in order to deal with a drone issue. So the question here is, are these benign? Like, what is going on? Are these planes are these actual is there actual a drone infestation? Senator Andy Kim, who's, from new Jersey, a senator for new Jersey, said he went out on local patrol with police in new Jersey and said that after going out with the police to observe reports of possible drones, the AI concluded that most of the drone sightings that were pointed out to me were almost certainly planes. That said, he criticized information delivery from federal officials, saying they weren't being transparent and that they should in their public communication, just compare this to a crisis CEO moment that you want to be as transparent as possible. Explain your reasoning, because right now the Pentagon and the FBI are saying, guys, it's not a big deal. They're everything's legal. They are planes. You're making all this up. That's just like, not a good community. Like a good, effective communication strategy. So senators and other law, state lawmakers are calling on the feds to say, okay, if there is nothing, explain how you found that out and let the people know, because they're getting a little frustrated and they're getting a little worried. One thing that could be contributing to this, though, is that even if a lot of the sightings are playing, some people could be actually seeing hobbyist drones because a 2023 FAA regulatory change did allow drones to be flown at night, which could possibly be behind some of the, increase in sightings. Plus U.S. law does really limit how the U.S. military can actually respond to drones. They're not allowed to just shoot them out of the air as they do need special authorization. They need to give special authorization to local authorities to deal with drones as well. And so maybe a combination of those two factors is leading to an increase in sightings. It could I mean, we could be talking about literally just a few pranksters or someone flying these drones around because they're allowed to at night, even though they aren't allowed to go into FAA restricted airspace. But still, maybe those are some of the factors that are contributing this as well. It's completely legal. Like they're there's 800,000 drone registrations now, which is the equivalent of the population of San Francisco. So there are a lot of drones flying around. You can fly them around at night. It's legal to fly a drone in most locations below 400ft. You don't really need anything else to send a drone up there. So, you know, there's they're like, there's nothing we can do. Like we can't shoot them down because we're not allowed to shoot down random drones that are flying legally because there's collateral damage over the local area and things like that. So, you know, we'll see what happens with this story. I think there is a push for more transparency from federal officials to just explain, just show their work, essentially. Up next, it is our winners of the weekend. Welcome to winners of the weekend, the segment where Toby and I picked two things that cemented their spot on Santa's nice list the past couple of days. I won the pre So I get to go first. My winner is anyone who hates changing the clocks twice a year, because now\n",

      "you have the most powerful person in the world on your side. Friday night, President elect Trump wrote on Truth Social that he wants to end daylight saving time, calling it, quote, inconvenient and very costly to our nation. He said he'll work with Republicans to make standard time permanent when he takes office. Just as a refresher, the idea behind daylight saving time is to shift an hour of sunlight from the morning to the evening during the summer months, so that people can enjoy the daylight during their time off from work and spend money to juice the economy. It became federal law in 1966, so now every state besides Hawaii and Arizona spring their clocks forward in March and fall back after Halloween every year. Toby, this debate has been raging for decades, and even though Americans say they don't want to keep changing the clocks, there's been a little political appetite to change it. Maybe Trump getting on board will give it the juice it needs to get across the finish line. You can make a lot of arguments for either side of this. Whether you want to stay with standard time or move to permanent daylight saving time is one of them is consumer spending. Most people say that when people spend money after work, it's better to have more sunshine available because you would go to stores because it's still light out. That being said, online shopping is a lot of people do most of their shopping these days. So does it really matter if it's light or dark out? Another thing too, is that daylight Savings Time is supposed to make your electric bill cheaper, but there hasn't been really any agreement on whether it actually does lower energy use. And then finally, sleep and health is a big one as well. Standard time when it's lighter in the mornings does help your circadian rhythm, because getting that sunlight. Anyone who listens to, you know, the Andrew Huberman pod knows that daylight exposure to sunlight exposure is probably good for you, provides a better night's sleep because it gets you on the screen with rhythm. But also more sunlight in the evenings is probably good for your mental health as well, because no one likes it being dark when you when you leave work every day. So for every argument for one side of the equation, some people have another argument arguing for the opposite right? But permanent standard time is just better. Oh, so Neil clearly thinks I'm clearly on that side. More sunlight in the morning. But I want to talk about this discrepancy because Trump said that he wants permanent standard time, which you don't believe because you think he messed up, because Trump, because the general political consensus. There have been bills introduced in 2022 and 2023 by Marco Rubio, a Republican wanting permanent daylight saving time, because that is where you get the most. You maximize the evening sunlight, which seems to be a little more politically palatable, permanent standard time is the one of is what people like wonky. You know, the wonks want the sleep association, the medical health experts. That's they want permanent standard time. But in terms of, you know, what is more politically feasible? It's daylight saving time permanent. So you think that he maybe misspoke here and wants daylight saving time permanent? Yeah. When I think when he said he wants to end daylight saving, he means he wants to make daylight saving permanent because that is what he expressed support for back in 2019. He tweeted out support for permanent DST back in 2019. So I do think that by ending it, he just means we don't want to shift clocks anymore, pick one way or the other, right? And I think the way, based off his previous statements is he wants to make DST permanent. My win over the weekend is Hot Wheels because they are on fire right now.\n",

      "The 56 year old brand is the best selling toy in the world, according to the market research firm Circrna. With fans stretching from three year olds all the way up to 63 year olds. It's one of the stand out lines under the Mattel umbrella, going toe to toe the likes of Barbie, and saw its sales grow 14% to reach nearly $1.5 billion last year. At its current pace, Mattel sells 22.5 Hot Wheels cars per second, good for 791 million cars a year. You know, a lot of trends are taking Hot Wheels into high gear. One, they are cheap, but most starting at just one dollars and $0.25 apiece, too. Nostalgia is in right now, and these cars evoke warm feelings of childhood fun. And three there is a major collector scene with adults fanatics driving about one third of global revenue, according to the company. The only way I can describe it, Neil, is Hot Wheels is hot. They are hot. They are also licensing their IP, which you're seeing from Barbie and other toy brands, is a great way to maximize revenue. Of course, there's a Hot Wheels, movie coming on the heels of Barbie. Mattel is like, oh well, Barbie sales jumped 16% after it released the Barbie movie. You know, let's do that for Hot Wheels too. That's already growing at 14% a year. Why don't we do sales even more? I think, you know, I think they just have so many. We talked about Broadcom having a very narrow customer base. Hot wheels has literally everybody on the planet buying Hot Wheels for various different reasons. You have the kids that want it just for fun. You have the adults that are literally paying $99 a year for a subscription to get the latest collectible models. That is recurring revenue for a toy company. That's kind of unheard of. So this company is clicking on all cylinders, and it just goes back to maybe American's love affair with cars. It really does. I do think you can't overlook price either, because selling for a $1.25 a piece, that's a big draw in an inflationary environment, especially if you think if you actually do the math, the toys cost less today than they did in 1968. They retailed for about 69 to $0.89 back in the 60s and 70s. But that's roughly 6 to $8 in today's dollars. So it's one I want to know where are they making these? I know their level of craftsmanship cannot be right. There has been a little bit of pushback because people have shown the bottom of Hot Wheels cars and how over time, they've been a little simplified. Because you're right, they are producing a lot. But one of the things is, I mean, I mentioned that they're selling 22.5 Hot Wheels toys per second. They're also making 22.5 Hot Wheels toys per second. So that level of scale allows them to sell them for very cheaply. And maybe it's subsidized by this subscription plan that some people are talking about. One, fun story about this, the Mattel toy umbrella, whatever you want to call it. The connection between Barbie and Hot Wheels runs very deep because Hot Wheels creator Elliott Handler was married to the woman behind Barbie, Ruth Handler. If that isn't fate, or if that isn't just an aligning of these\n",

      "toy forces and I don't know what is, it's Monday, and as per tradition here are the events you need to know about for the week ahead. The fed is holding its final meeting of the year on Wednesday, and it's overwhelmingly expected to cut rates. A standard quarter percentage point, the third rate cut this year. Well, that's pretty much locked in. The big question mark is its rate path. In 2025. Inflation is proving to be more stubborn than anticipated, hovering above that 2% target. And Trump's economic policies like tariffs could complicate the picture even more. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg have a median estimate of three rate cuts. Next year, but we'll see what Jay Powell says. This might be the last meeting where we know what's going to happen, because there are just so many question marks on the horizon. Does inflation that just jump back up or are these tariffs going to be more of a bargaining chip if they do go into effect and jack up prices, that's when the situation becomes a little murky. Because how can you go ahead with rate cuts if you see inflation starting to creep back in. Probably camp baby. It's cold outside. And if you plan on hunkering down, there's plenty to watch on the screen, big and small, Mr. Beast Squid Game inspired a competition show beast games hits Amazon Prime Video on Thursday, offering a grand prize of $5 million. Mufasa, the prequel to 2019 live action Lion King, arrives in theaters on Friday. And then, if you want to impress your film major friends, go see Oscar contender The Brutal List starring Adrien Brody, also out on Friday. I don't know, I mean, the only one I'm interested in is the brutalist because The Lion King prequel I just haven't seen much buzz about. Even though 2019 Lion King grossed $1.7 billion worldwide, that is a gigantic number. I can't see this. It just doesn't seem like there's been much buzz about it. And then Squid Games, I can't believe, are still doing well. Mr. Beast. I know it's Mr. Beast, but still like it feels like Squid Games cultural relevance has passed. They did release another season and Squid Games on YouTube that what he recreated did do very well. But I don't know. It's hard for me to get excited. It's a two. It's a big, big deal for the creator economy, if you want to call it that. For Mr. Beast to move beyond YouTube to the streaming and TV realm. So we'll see how that goes out. I mean, I'm not gonna lie. Let's be honest. In sports, here's an awesome story. The University of Vermont will play in its first ever championship game in any sport tonight, when the Catamounts take on Marshall for the men's soccer title tonight. No disrespect to the Catamounts, but they eliminated my younger brother in his final collegiate game ever in the NCAA tournament, so I forever have a beef with them. So to see them doing well is a little bittersweet for me. But congrats to the Catamounts! That is an awesome achievement and I will be tuning in to watch that. Okay, that is all the time we have. Thanks so much for starting your morning with us and have a wonderful start to the week.
