       "\"0s - October 19th, 2015 election night in Canada, 5s - dissatisfied with the direction of the country. 7s - Record numbers of Canadians came out to vote. 10s - The result. 11s - Justin Trudeau is elected Prime Minister 14s - of Canada, with a large crowd cheering his name. 18s - Trudeau had one simple message. 20s - It's time for a change in this country, my friends. 24s - A real change. 28s - Canadians across the country were excited and energized. 31s - They believed in a bright future for Canada. 34s - The government would build more homes, make life 37s - more affordable and usher Canada into a golden age. 41s - The Canadian dream. 43s - But fast forward to today, and that dream has faded. 46s - Housing prices have increased at record rates. 50s - Food banks are turning away hungry Canadians, 53s - and immigrants are leaving in record numbers. 56s - The Canadian dream has become a nightmare. 59s - This is the dark side of Canada. 62s - If you talk to real Canadians, more often than not, 64s - they will tell you how hopeless 66s - they feel about their future. 67s - They'll share how, when growing up, they dreamed 69s - of a life raising a family in a comfortable home 72s - and in a safe neighborhood. 74s - Or with home prices soaring. 75s - This dream has become a fantasy 78s - to buy the average home in Canada. 79s - A family needs to earn $170,000 per year. 84s - And in Vancouver that number jumps dramatically 86s - to $360,000 per year. 89s - Compare this to the median family income of $70,000. 93s - And it becomes clear 95s - that it is nearly impossible to buy a home in Canada. 98s - Most Canadians who don't own a home have given up and don't 101s - see it as remotely possible in their lifetime. 104s - The sad part about this 106s - Canada's housing wasn't always this expensive. 109s - In fact, homeownership was possible for almost everyone. 112s - But in the last few decades, 114s - housing prices have increased so much faster than wages 117s - that it has forced citizens 119s - to abandon the hope of homeownership. 121s - Even if you can afford a home, 123s - you aren't getting very much. 125s - Take Vancouver, for example. 127s - The average home 127s - here is nearly $2 million, and it looks like this. 132s - Who wants to spend 133s - nearly $2 million on a small home like this? 136s - When you can get a mansion in places like Austin 139s - for the same amount? 140s - Now, not everyone wants to buy a home, and many 143s - are perfectly fine renting. 145s - But renting is just as hard as buying a home due to years 149s - of under building NIMBYism, population 152s - growth and government red tape. 154s - The supply of rental units is far outweighed by demand 158s - Across Canada, 159s - rental vacancy sits at an all time low of 1.5%. 164s - This means people are fighting to find a place to live. 167s - Each application for an apartment is met 169s - with hundreds of competing applications, 171s - and renters are left feeling hopeless. 174s - It's getting to the point 174s - where you can choose to keep a roof over your head, 177s - or you can choose to keep the lights on and eat. 178s - But you can't do both. 179s - The low levels of vacancy 181s - are leading to skyrocketing prices. 184s - Landlords realize that renters have few options, 187s - and therefore they continue to raise rents 189s - to extract maximum value. 191s - Our landlord increased our rent by 7000 per month. 195s - The outcome? 197s - Rents continue to rise uncontrollably 200s - and will do so for years to come. 202s - For example, the average one bedroom apartment in Toronto 205s - and Vancouver is nearly $3,000. 208s - After taxes and rent, Canadians barely 210s - have enough money to make ends meet. 212s - People are skipping meals, taking up multiple jobs, 215s - living in their cars, and more. 217s - Debt has become an absolute necessity to make ends meet. 220s - And Canada now has the third 222s - highest household debt to GDP ratio on Earth. 226s - All of this is compounded 227s - by the inability of the government to help. 230s - In fact, 231s - many would argue that the government 233s - is making life much harder for Canadians. 236s - The problem with housing affordability is a combination 239s - of federal and local government policies 241s - and inaction on a federal level. 244s - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has overseen 246s - the largest increase in Canadian real estate prices 249s - in history. 250s - Much of this is due to his immigration policy. 253s - Since 2016, the government has admitted 255s - nearly 3 million immigrants into the country. 258s - That is a record and 40% higher per year 262s - in the last few decades. 263s - To make matters worse, there are over 1 million 266s - foreign students in the country. 268s - By increasing the population so significantly 271s - in such a short period of time. 273s - The government has squeezed 274s - an already under built housing market. 277s - It is simple economics. 278s - Increasing demand without increasing supply 281s - causes prices to go up. 283s - Furthermore, most immigrants are looking 285s - for entry level homes and apartments, 288s - placing a disproportionate amount of pressure 290s - on average, and young Canadians 292s - who are looking for a starter property. 294s - For example, many students at UBC 296s - can no longer find housing 298s - and now live in vans and parking lots to survive. 301s - I have to wait, 302s - I guess like more than a year to get housing 305s - on campus in UBC. 306s - One student even flies from a different city 309s - because it's cheaper than rent. 311s - Rooming houses are also commonplace 314s - across the country, 315s - where landlords squeeze 316s - five students into one bedroom to maximize profit. 319s - Immigration isn't the only reason 321s - for rising prices, though, 323s - and it's easy for folks to point the finger. 325s - But Canada has underinvested in housing for decades. 328s - In fact, CIBC estimates that Canada needs 5 million 332s - more homes by 2030 to achieve affordability targets. 337s - Developers agree this is impossible. 340s - Of course, 340s - you can't flip the switch overnight to build homes. 343s - And in Canada, local governments 345s - have shown an unwillingness to invest in housing. 348s - For one, citizens who own homes are often 351s - against development 352s - as it would lower the value of their properties. 354s - Permit approvals are hard to get, 356s - and NIMBYism challenges most large developments. 359s - Elected officials know this 361s - and therefore don't push hard for housing to avoid losing 363s - an election. 364s - Furthermore, each city and province levies 367s - a multitude of taxes 368s - that drive the cost and timeline for development. 371s - In some cities, 372s - this can add over 20% to the cost of a home, 375s - and this cost is directly 377s - passed on to consumers by developers. 379s - A part of the reason taxes and red 381s - tape continue to increase 383s - is the government is growing faster than the population. 386s - From 2020 to 2023. 388s - The B.C. government grew by 23%. 391s - Compare this to the private sector, which grew by only 1%. 395s - This explosive job growth requires more taxes. 399s - A similar pattern can be seen in the federal government, 401s - which has added nearly $20 billion a year in costs 404s - since 2015, and the final nail 407s - in the coffin for housing affordability. 409s - Foreign Investment 410s - Canada is an extremely attractive 412s - and safe place to invest your money, 414s - but it also happens to be one of the easiest places 417s - in the OECD to launder money. 420s - Another bombshell in the ongoing money 422s - laundering scandal in B.C., 423s - a report commissioned by the government 425s - agreed and concluded 426s - that significant amounts of black market money 429s - was buying 430s - and selling properties in Canada, 431s - especially Vancouver and Toronto. 434s - But what has the government done to stop this? 436s - Nothing. 437s - Money laundering is just as easy as ever. 440s - Now housing is just one component of this nightmare. 443s - What about everyday costs Canadians face? 446s - Canada saw food prices rise by over 10% since 2022, 451s - leading nearly 451s - 2 million Canadians to visit food banks in March of 2023, 455s - a record high and double the 2019 levels. 459s - One of the reasons Canadian 460s - food prices are so high is the lack of competition. 463s - But grocery chain profits are not the reason 467s - for food inflation. 468s - A handful of companies own nearly 80% market share. 473s - The government has historically done 474s - nothing to prevent food industry consolidation, 477s - which has led to a highly concentrated market 479s - that is able to extract maximum profits. 482s - The worst 482s - example of this is bread, 484s - which is dominated by only two players. 486s - Not only this, 487s - but the government has assisted 489s - in increasing food prices in Canada 491s - by protecting the poultry, egg and dairy industries. 494s - This alone cost the average Canadian family 497s - nearly $450 per year. 500s - That could be the difference between making rent or not. 503s - The federal plan 504s - puts a price on pollution that brings down emissions, 507s - and it spurs innovation on the kind of investments 511s - in emissions reduction that we need. 512s - While at the same time putting more money 516s - in the pockets of Canadians, this story of government 518s - policies leading to higher prices is nothing new. 521s - For example, 522s - the government 522s - introduced a carbon tax which makes the cost of gas 525s - and heating more expensive than ever. 527s - Canadians spend more on gas than any other G7 country 531s - by a long shot. 532s - The carbon tax has been met 533s - with significant pushback from citizens and politicians. 537s - In fact, 537s - Liberal MPs have spoken out against the carbon tax 540s - as the number of complaints 542s - from constituents has risen dramatically. 544s - This came to a head in the Atlantic provinces 546s - when citizens could no longer bear 548s - the cost of the carbon tax. 550s - Given the use of expensive and very dirty fuel oil, 553s - the Liberal government conceded and dropped the tax 556s - in an effort to not lose support. 558s - Recently, the government has pushed the 560s - narrative that most citizens are better off 563s - in spite of carbon taxes due to rebates. 566s - However, 567s - the parliamentary budget officer 568s - clarified and said that citizens are worse off 571s - if you include the economic implications. 573s - But this isn't just limited to carbon taxes. 576s - Canadians experience higher prices across 579s - multiple industries because of the government. 581s - The most glaring example is telecommunications. 584s - Here's a quick question. 585s - Are we paying too much for cell phone 587s - and internet bills here in Canada? 588s - Absolutely. 589s - The Canadian wireless market is the most expensive 592s - in the world, 593s - seven times more expensive in Australia, and 1000 times 596s - more expensive than Finland. 598s - The craziest part is that the fourth largest 600s - player, Shaw, was recently acquired 602s - by the largest player in the country. 604s - Rogers and the government did nothing to stop it. 607s - In most countries, 608s - such a deal would most likely be stopped or delayed. 611s - But in Canada, 612s - major corporations 613s - have extreme influence and often 615s - get away with these anti-competitive transactions. 618s - Banking is similar. 619s - There is no competition nor options for consumers 622s - to start up. 623s - A bank is nearly impossible in Canada due to tight 626s - regulatory controls that favor large entities. 630s - This has led to Canadians paying some of the highest 632s - banking fees in the developed world. 634s - It is estimated that Canadians pay $250 more per year 638s - on banking fees than peers in the UK and Australia. 641s - Why? No competition. 644s - Now I could list a million more examples, 647s - but the conclusion is the same. 649s - Canada is extremely expensive. 651s - One way to counter this is to grow 653s - the economy and introduce high paying jobs. 656s - However, Canada has struggled to do this. 658s - Since 2019, Canada has seen a decline 661s - in economic productivity. 663s - While the US has seen a 6% increase. 666s - This decline 667s - is partly responsible for stagnant wages in Canada 670s - and reduction in the quality of life. 672s - One of the drivers for this decline is lack of private 675s - sector investment. 676s - Canadian businesses are investing 678s - outside of Canada more than ever before. 680s - But why aren't companies investing in Canada? 683s - Simply put, 684s - they believe they can generate greater returns elsewhere, 686s - especially as they lose faith 688s - in the current Canadian regime, 690s - which is not seen as business friendly. 692s - Another reason is lack of competition. 695s - Most major Canadian industries 697s - are controlled by a few key players. 699s - These players have no real incentive to invest, 702s - leading to reductions in productivity. 704s - The US has low levels of market 706s - concentration across industries, 708s - leading to constant reinvestment and innovation. 710s - As companies continue to seek a competitive edge, 713s - another reason is government intervention. 716s - For example, Canada has seen a major decline 718s - in investment in the energy sector 720s - due to federal prices that penalize the industry. 723s - Since 2014, energy investment has declined 726s - by nearly $60 billion per year. 729s - But one could argue that oil and gas is the past, 732s - and Canada should focus on future proofing its economy. 735s - Which is absolutely fair. 736s - However, since 2016, GDP derived from technology 740s - companies has only grown with inflation, 743s - meaning it hasn't really grown at all. 745s - All efforts by the government to incentivize 747s - industrial investment have failed. 749s - But this is not simply limited 751s - to large businesses and money outflow. 753s - Canada is seeing an exodus of startups and top talent 757s - like never before. 758s - Each year, 7% of Canadians go south of the border 762s - searching for opportunity. 763s - And why wouldn't they? 764s - Jobs pay more. 766s - Cost of living is lower and the US is much more dynamic. 769s - The loser in this scenario is not the government, 772s - but hard working Canadians whose lives continue to become 775s - more difficult as productivity continues to decline. 779s - The central bank will have less leeway 780s - to maintain lower interest rates, 782s - further challenging cost of living. 784s - Overall, the outlook does not look great. 788s - Let's hope that something changes soon. 790s - Subscribe to 2&20 for more business and economics insight.\""

       "\n",
       "**Housing Affordability**\n",
       "(10s) The result: record numbers of Canadians came out to vote, electing Justin Trudeau as Prime Minister. (14s) Trudeau's message: \"It's time for a change in this country, my friends. A real change.\" (18s) But, fast-forward to today, and the Canadian dream has faded.\n",
       "\n",
       "**The Dark Side of Canada**\n",
       "(46s) Housing prices have increased at record rates, food banks are turning away hungry Canadians, and immigrants are leaving in record numbers. (56s) The Canadian dream has become a nightmare.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Housing Market**\n",
       "(74s) The average home price in Canada is out of reach for most people, with a family needing to earn $170,000 per year to buy a home. (84s) In Vancouver, the number jumps to $360,000 per year.\n",

       "**Government Inaction**\n",

       "\n",
       "**Immigration and Housing**\n",
       "(250s) The government's immigration policy has contributed to the housing crisis, with nearly 3 million immigrants admitted into the country since 2016, leading to increased demand for housing.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Underinvestment in Housing**\n",
       "(328s) Canada needs 5 million more homes by 2030 to achieve affordability targets, but developers agree that this is impossible due to a lack of investment.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Money Laundering and Housing**\n",
       "(420s) Canada is an attractive place for money laundering, with a report concluding that significant amounts of black market money is buying and selling properties in Canada.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Food Prices and Inflation**\n",
       "(451s) Food prices have risen by over 10% since 2022, leading to a record high of nearly 2 million Canadians visiting food banks in March 2023.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Carbon Tax and Inflation**\n",

       "0s - October 19th, 2015 election night in Canada,<br>5s - dissatisfied with the direction of the country.<br>7s - Record numbers of Canadians came out to vote.<br>10s - The result.<br>11s - Justin Trudeau is elected Prime Minister<br>14s - of Canada, with a large crowd cheering his name.<br>18s - Trudeau had one simple message.<br>20s - It's time for a change in this country, my friends.<br>24s - A real change.<br>28s - Canadians across the country were excited and energized.<br>31s - They believed in a bright future for Canada.<br>34s - The government would build more homes, make life<br>37s - more affordable and usher Canada into a golden age.<br>41s - The Canadian dream.<br>43s - But fast forward to today, and that dream has faded.<br>46s - Housing prices have increased at record rates.<br>50s - Food banks are turning away hungry Canadians,<br>53s - and immigrants are leaving in record numbers.<br>56s - The Canadian dream has become a nightmare.<br>59s - This is the dark side of Canada.<br>62s - If you talk to real Canadians, more often than not,<br>64s - they will tell you how hopeless<br>66s - they feel about their future.<br>67s - They'll share how, when growing up, they dreamed<br>69s - of a life raising a family in a comfortable home<br>72s - and in a safe neighborhood.<br>74s - Or with home prices soaring.<br>75s - This dream has become a fantasy<br>78s - to buy the average home in Canada.<br>79s - A family needs to earn $170,000 per year.<br>84s - And in Vancouver that number jumps dramatically<br>86s - to $360,000 per year.<br>89s - Compare this to the median family income of $70,000.<br>93s - And it becomes clear<br>95s - that it is nearly impossible to buy a home in Canada.<br>98s - Most Canadians who don't own a home have given up and don't<br>101s - see it as remotely possible in their lifetime.<br>104s - The sad part about this<br>106s - Canada's housing wasn't always this expensive.<br>109s - In fact, homeownership was possible for almost everyone.<br>112s - But in the last few decades,<br>114s - housing prices have increased so much faster than wages<br>117s - that it has forced citizens<br>119s - to abandon the hope of homeownership.<br>121s - Even if you can afford a home,<br>123s - you aren't getting very much.<br>125s - Take Vancouver, for example.<br>127s - The average home<br>127s - here is nearly $2 million, and it looks like this.<br>132s - Who wants to spend<br>133s - nearly $2 million on a small home like this?<br>136s - When you can get a mansion in places like Austin<br>139s - for the same amount?<br>140s - Now, not everyone wants to buy a home, and many<br>143s - are perfectly fine renting.<br>145s - But renting is just as hard as buying a home due to years<br>149s - of under building NIMBYism, population<br>152s - growth and government red tape.<br>154s - The supply of rental units is far outweighed by demand<br>158s - Across Canada,<br>159s - rental vacancy sits at an all time low of 1.5%.<br>164s - This means people are fighting to find a place to live.<br>167s - Each application for an apartment is met<br>169s - with hundreds of competing applications,<br>171s - and renters are left feeling hopeless.<br>174s - It's getting to the point<br>174s - where you can choose to keep a roof over your head,<br>177s - or you can choose to keep the lights on and eat.<br>178s - But you can't do both.<br>179s - The low levels of vacancy<br>181s - are leading to skyrocketing prices.<br>184s - Landlords realize that renters have few options,<br>187s - and therefore they continue to raise rents<br>189s - to extract maximum value.<br>191s - Our landlord increased our rent by 7000 per month.<br>195s - The outcome?<br>197s - Rents continue to rise uncontrollably<br>200s - and will do so for years to come.<br>202s - For example, the average one bedroom apartment in Toronto<br>205s - and Vancouver is nearly $3,000.<br>208s - After taxes and rent, Canadians barely<br>210s - have enough money to make ends meet.<br>212s - People are skipping meals, taking up multiple jobs,<br>215s - living in their cars, and more.<br>217s - Debt has become an absolute necessity to make ends meet.<br>220s - And Canada now has the third<br>222s - highest household debt to GDP ratio on Earth.<br>226s - All of this is compounded<br>227s - by the inability of the government to help.<br>230s - In fact,<br>231s - many would argue that the government<br>233s - is making life much harder for Canadians.<br>236s - The problem with housing affordability is a combination<br>239s - of federal and local government policies<br>241s - and inaction on a federal level.<br>244s - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has overseen<br>246s - the largest increase in Canadian real estate prices<br>249s - in history.<br>250s - Much of this is due to his immigration policy.<br>253s - Since 2016, the government has admitted<br>255s - nearly 3 million immigrants into the country.<br>258s - That is a record and 40% higher per year<br>262s - in the last few decades.<br>263s - To make matters worse, there are over 1 million<br>266s - foreign students in the country.<br>268s - By increasing the population so significantly<br>271s - in such a short period of time.<br>273s - The government has squeezed<br>274s - an already under built housing market.<br>277s - It is simple economics.<br>278s - Increasing demand without increasing supply<br>281s - causes prices to go up.<br>283s - Furthermore, most immigrants are looking<br>285s - for entry level homes and apartments,<br>288s - placing a disproportionate amount of pressure<br>290s - on average, and young Canadians<br>292s - who are looking for a starter property.<br>294s - For example, many students at UBC<br>296s - can no longer find housing<br>298s - and now live in vans and parking lots to survive.<br>301s - I have to wait,<br>302s - I guess like more than a year to get housing<br>305s - on campus in UBC.<br>306s - One student even flies from a different city<br>309s - because it's cheaper than rent.<br>311s - Rooming houses are also commonplace<br>314s - across the country,<br>315s - where landlords squeeze<br>316s - five students into one bedroom to maximize profit.<br>319s - Immigration isn't the only reason<br>321s - for rising prices, though,<br>323s - and it's easy for folks to point the finger.<br>325s - But Canada has underinvested in housing for decades.<br>328s - In fact, CIBC estimates that Canada needs 5 million<br>332s - more homes by 2030 to achieve affordability targets.<br>337s - Developers agree this is impossible.<br>340s - Of course,<br>340s - you can't flip the switch overnight to build homes.<br>343s - And in Canada, local governments<br>345s - have shown an unwillingness to invest in housing.<br>348s - For one, citizens who own homes are often<br>351s - against development<br>352s - as it would lower the value of their properties.<br>354s - Permit approvals are hard to get,<br>356s - and NIMBYism challenges most large developments.<br>359s - Elected officials know this<br>361s - and therefore don't push hard for housing to avoid losing<br>363s - an election.<br>364s - Furthermore, each city and province levies<br>367s - a multitude of taxes<br>368s - that drive the cost and timeline for development.<br>371s - In some cities,<br>372s - this can add over 20% to the cost of a home,<br>375s - and this cost is directly<br>377s - passed on to consumers by developers.<br>379s - A part of the reason taxes and red<br>381s - tape continue to increase<br>383s - is the government is growing faster than the population.<br>386s - From 2020 to 2023.<br>388s - The B.C. government grew by 23%.<br>391s - Compare this to the private sector, which grew by only 1%.<br>395s - This explosive job growth requires more taxes.<br>399s - A similar pattern can be seen in the federal government,<br>401s - which has added nearly $20 billion a year in costs<br>404s - since 2015, and the final nail<br>407s - in the coffin for housing affordability.<br>409s - Foreign Investment<br>410s - Canada is an extremely attractive<br>412s - and safe place to invest your money,<br>414s - but it also happens to be one of the easiest places<br>417s - in the OECD to launder money.<br>420s - Another bombshell in the ongoing money<br>422s - laundering scandal in B.C.,<br>423s - a report commissioned by the government<br>425s - agreed and concluded<br>426s - that significant amounts of black market money<br>429s - was buying<br>430s - and selling properties in Canada,<br>431s - especially Vancouver and Toronto.<br>434s - But what has the government done to stop this?<br>436s - Nothing.<br>437s - Money laundering is just as easy as ever.<br>440s - Now housing is just one component of this nightmare.<br>443s - What about everyday costs Canadians face?<br>446s - Canada saw food prices rise by over 10% since 2022,<br>451s - leading nearly<br>451s - 2 million Canadians to visit food banks in March of 2023,<br>455s - a record high and double the 2019 levels.<br>459s - One of the reasons Canadian<br>460s - food prices are so high is the lack of competition.<br>463s - But grocery chain profits are not the reason<br>467s - for food inflation.<br>468s - A handful of companies own nearly 80% market share.<br>473s - The government has historically done<br>474s - nothing to prevent food industry consolidation,<br>477s - which has led to a highly concentrated market<br>479s - that is able to extract maximum profits.<br>482s - The worst<br>482s - example of this is bread,<br>484s - which is dominated by only two players.<br>486s - Not only this,<br>487s - but the government has assisted<br>489s - in increasing food prices in Canada<br>491s - by protecting the poultry, egg and dairy industries.<br>494s - This alone cost the average Canadian family<br>497s - nearly $450 per year.<br>500s - That could be the difference between making rent or not.<br>503s - The federal plan<br>504s - puts a price on pollution that brings down emissions,<br>507s - and it spurs innovation on the kind of investments<br>511s - in emissions reduction that we need.<br>512s - While at the same time putting more money<br>516s - in the pockets of Canadians, this story of government<br>518s - policies leading to higher prices is nothing new.<br>521s - For example,<br>522s - the government<br>522s - introduced a carbon tax which makes the cost of gas<br>525s - and heating more expensive than ever.<br>527s - Canadians spend more on gas than any other G7 country<br>531s - by a long shot.<br>532s - The carbon tax has been met<br>533s - with significant pushback from citizens and politicians.<br>537s - In fact,<br>537s - Liberal MPs have spoken out against the carbon tax<br>540s - as the number of complaints<br>542s - from constituents has risen dramatically.<br>544s - This came to a head in the Atlantic provinces<br>546s - when citizens could no longer bear<br>548s - the cost of the carbon tax.<br>550s - Given the use of expensive and very dirty fuel oil,<br>553s - the Liberal government conceded and dropped the tax<br>556s - in an effort to not lose support.<br>558s - Recently, the government has pushed the<br>560s - narrative that most citizens are better off<br>563s - in spite of carbon taxes due to rebates.<br>566s - However,<br>567s - the parliamentary budget officer<br>568s - clarified and said that citizens are worse off<br>571s - if you include the economic implications.<br>573s - But this isn't just limited to carbon taxes.<br>576s - Canadians experience higher prices across<br>579s - multiple industries because of the government.<br>581s - The most glaring example is telecommunications.<br>584s - Here's a quick question.<br>585s - Are we paying too much for cell phone<br>587s - and internet bills here in Canada?<br>588s - Absolutely.<br>589s - The Canadian wireless market is the most expensive<br>592s - in the world,<br>593s - seven times more expensive in Australia, and 1000 times<br>596s - more expensive than Finland.<br>598s - The craziest part is that the fourth largest<br>600s - player, Shaw, was recently acquired<br>602s - by the largest player in the country.<br>604s - Rogers and the government did nothing to stop it.<br>607s - In most countries,<br>608s - such a deal would most likely be stopped or delayed.<br>611s - But in Canada,<br>612s - major corporations<br>613s - have extreme influence and often<br>615s - get away with these anti-competitive transactions.<br>618s - Banking is similar.<br>619s - There is no competition nor options for consumers<br>622s - to start up.<br>623s - A bank is nearly impossible in Canada due to tight<br>626s - regulatory controls that favor large entities.<br>630s - This has led to Canadians paying some of the highest<br>632s - banking fees in the developed world.<br>634s - It is estimated that Canadians pay $250 more per year<br>638s - on banking fees than peers in the UK and Australia.<br>641s - Why? No competition.<br>644s - Now I could list a million more examples,<br>647s - but the conclusion is the same.<br>649s - Canada is extremely expensive.<br>651s - One way to counter this is to grow<br>653s - the economy and introduce high paying jobs.<br>656s - However, Canada has struggled to do this.<br>658s - Since 2019, Canada has seen a decline<br>661s - in economic productivity.<br>663s - While the US has seen a 6% increase.<br>666s - This decline<br>667s - is partly responsible for stagnant wages in Canada<br>670s - and reduction in the quality of life.<br>672s - One of the drivers for this decline is lack of private<br>675s - sector investment.<br>676s - Canadian businesses are investing<br>678s - outside of Canada more than ever before.<br>680s - But why aren't companies investing in Canada?<br>683s - Simply put,<br>684s - they believe they can generate greater returns elsewhere,<br>686s - especially as they lose faith<br>688s - in the current Canadian regime,<br>690s - which is not seen as business friendly.<br>692s - Another reason is lack of competition.<br>695s - Most major Canadian industries<br>697s - are controlled by a few key players.<br>699s - These players have no real incentive to invest,<br>702s - leading to reductions in productivity.<br>704s - The US has low levels of market<br>706s - concentration across industries,<br>708s - leading to constant reinvestment and innovation.<br>710s - As companies continue to seek a competitive edge,<br>713s - another reason is government intervention.<br>716s - For example, Canada has seen a major decline<br>718s - in investment in the energy sector<br>720s - due to federal prices that penalize the industry.<br>723s - Since 2014, energy investment has declined<br>726s - by nearly $60 billion per year.<br>729s - But one could argue that oil and gas is the past,<br>732s - and Canada should focus on future proofing its economy.<br>735s - Which is absolutely fair.<br>736s - However, since 2016, GDP derived from technology<br>740s - companies has only grown with inflation,<br>743s - meaning it hasn't really grown at all.<br>745s - All efforts by the government to incentivize<br>747s - industrial investment have failed.<br>749s - But this is not simply limited<br>751s - to large businesses and money outflow.<br>753s - Canada is seeing an exodus of startups and top talent<br>757s - like never before.<br>758s - Each year, 7% of Canadians go south of the border<br>762s - searching for opportunity.<br>763s - And why wouldn't they?<br>764s - Jobs pay more.<br>766s - Cost of living is lower and the US is much more dynamic.<br>769s - The loser in this scenario is not the government,<br>772s - but hard working Canadians whose lives continue to become<br>775s - more difficult as productivity continues to decline.<br>779s - The central bank will have less leeway<br>780s - to maintain lower interest rates,<br>782s - further challenging cost of living.<br>784s - Overall, the outlook does not look great.<br>788s - Let's hope that something changes soon.<br>790s - Subscribe to 2&20 for more business and economics insight."

      "Good Morning Brew Daily Show. I'm Neal Freyman. And I'm Toby Howell. today. It's not Barbie. It's not Lego. The best selling toy in the world is. Yeah. You're going to have to wait for that then. It's a bird. It's a plane. No, it's a drone hovering over new Jersey. But in reality, it's probably a plane. It's Monday, December 16th. Let's ride. The holiday season is full of heartwarming stories of generosity and giving back. And I got another one for you right here last week. The extremely popular author James Patterson handed out $500 holiday bonuses to 600 employees at independent bookstores across the country. It's a tradition he started in 2015, inviting thousands of booksellers to apply and picking hundreds of winners from the nominees. In a statement, Patterson said booksellers save lives, period. I'm happy to be able to acknowledge them and all their hard work this holiday season. I mean, it does warm the heart. James Patterson is also a juggernaut. He sold more than 425 million copies of his book. His total income over the last decade is estimated at $700 million. That being said, his books have been described as a literary equivalent of Kentucky Fried Chicken, and he's often been criticized for coauthoring a lot of his stories. But a lot of people enjoy Kentucky Fried Chicken Meal, and it means some of his profits go towards these independent booksellers. Sometimes you just have to tip your cap and say, that is a good deed. Now, a word from our sponsor, the Range Rover Sport. That's right Neil, we're finishing off the year in style. Style is a great word for it because the new Range Rover Sport oozes class. Each model offers a sophisticated take on sporting luxury, so you can cruise in style but also get a little adventurous with its off roading capabilities. It's a dual threat Neal focused on road performance, but with world famous off road capability. It's the fire and ice of cars. The Toby and Neil of cars. Okay, but who's the off road power and who's the on road cruising? I think you're giving some off road vibes these days. Could be the 5:00 shadow. If you want a taste of the finer things and the wild side, build your Range Rover Sport at Land Rover usa.com.\n",

      "(Timestamp: 2:15) Tech CEOs donate to Trump\n",
      "Transcript:\n",
      "Today, America's top tech moguls are marching one by one to Mar a Lago, a pilgrimage they hope will repair a rocky relationship with president elect Trump and curry favor with the upcoming administration. Last week, it was Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim Cook making the trek from California to Palm Beach. Before Thanksgiving, it was Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and this week, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos will have dinner with Trump. Meanwhile, meta, Amazon and OpenAI Sam Altman are writing checks to Trump, with all three saying last week they would contribute $1 million to his inaugural fund. For some historical context, it is not unusual for CEOs to cozy up to an incoming administration. The white House sets policies that will have major impacts on their companies, and they want to make sure their interests are being heard. This has been going on for decades, but for the tech industry in particular, it is a striking reversal. Silicon Valley and Trump were no fans of each other during his first stint in the white House, and shortly thereafter. It's certainly a sign of the times that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who a few years ago had been a major Democratic supporter, said last week it was a time of great promise for our nation. Yeah. After keeping the Trump administration or the Trump campaign out a little bit of an arm's length during the campaign season, a lot of these CEOs are saying, you know what? I do not want to risk being on bad terms with Trump. Let's go speak with him face to face. Let's go to Mar and just see what he's about and see if we can create this relationship. The thing about some of these inaugural fund donations, too, is what it does is guarantee you some face time with Trump and Vance, because donors to the, inauguration fund do get invitation to inauguration ball access to a candlelit dinner with the Trumps. And then, they also have a access to reception with the cabinet picks. So what you are seeing is paying $1 million, saying, like, I do want to have more opportunities to have FaceTime with you. And also one thing about inaugural committees is that they are pretty low stakes in terms of donations. They are seen as a very normal thing for companies to do, to seek favor. There is a little bit of a guise of patriotism attached to it as well, without being seen as like overly partizan. So I wouldn't read too much into the fact that they're all donating exactly $1 million, because it does give you access to the events, and it is a rather normal thing to do to an incoming administration. I want to talk about one of these, tech moguls that is going to Mar this week, Jeff Bezos, because I think he is a good example of what can happen when the relationship with the president goes sour. During the first administration, Trump's first administration, he repeatedly bashed Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, for negative coverage. And that did translate to the business world. You know, Amazon contends that they lost out on a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the federal government to Microsoft because Trump did not like Bezos. So that was a big business impact, for Amazon because of that rocky relationship. So now you're seeing Bezos make the trek to Mar He moved to South Florida. Reportedly, he's become friends with Jared and Ivanka down there, and he's hoping to make them not make amends because he probably thinks he didn't do anything wrong. But, trying to trying to reestablish that relationship because the one thing all these guys have in common is they're catching up to Elon Musk. Elon Musk already has that bromance with Trump, and there is the potential that Trump or Elon Musk could use that power to cut them out of lucrative business deals. Right. He is the other power player that CEOs are also trying to figure out how to navigate the relationship, because a lot of those CEOs could be wary that Musk could just punish his business rivals, could push them to the side. Sam Altman is obviously a big one of those. Elon Musk has repeatedly sued OpenAI, saying that it for so, or it went back on its promise to be this, open company. And it now is a for profit entity. Altman has said that he hopes or he thinks Elon will do the right thing because he said it would be, quote, profoundly un that Elon has it to hurt your competitors and advantage your own businesses. So, I mean, that is that could be a very optimistic look at the situation. But, the reality is that Elon now has a ton of power in the administration. He could wield it one way or the other. And CEOs are trying to figure out how to navigate him as well as navigate Donald Trump. There is a new entrant into the 13 figure club.\n",

      "(Timestamp: 6:40) Broadcom quietly cashin’ in\n",
      "Transcript:\n",
      "Chipmaker Broadcom. Pull up a chair to sit at the $1 trillion market cap table just before the weekend. After reporting a breakout fourth quarter earnings, the stock jumped 24% to creep into uncharted territory and is now doubled in value this year. Unsurprisingly, it's been AI that has pushed Broadcom into the big leagues. It supplies advanced AI hardware to big tech companies much like Nvidia, but also has a robust software business as well. AI revenue is up 220% this year. And it's got to the point that when Broadcom does well, shares of Nvidia and competitors like AMD shrink on fears that incumbent AI stalwarts could lose market share to the surging Broadcom. Looking forward, the company's CEO, Hock Tan, expects its AI opportunity to reach $90 billion by 2027, powered by what it calls Hyperscaler customers, which are those companies like Meta and Google that require large scale data centers? You know, Broadcom is not a name that a lot of people know off the top of their heads, but they will soon. The last time I will say I thought about Broadcom was six years ago in 2018. And that was when Broadcom tried to buy Qualcomm for $120 billion. It would be one of the biggest, if not the biggest tech acquisitions of all time. Trump speaking of Trump, he blocked that deal from going forward because at the time Broadcom was based in Singapore and it was blocked over national security concerns. Turns out Broadcom did not name Qualcomm at all. Since 2018, Broadcom shares are up 760%. Qualcomm's up 165% and the S&P 500 is up 119%. So Broadcom easily outpacing the other guys. And that's really because of this AI revolution with ChatGPT in 2022 sales of its AI chips are up a lot. Sales of its non AI chips are down. So without AI Broadcom is probably looking more like Qualcomm. And now it's in the $1 trillion club. That being said though, its CEO Hock Tan loves to take these big swings. I mean it tried to swing acquire Qualcomm for the biggest tech acquisition ever. But it's also recently bought VMware for $61 billion. VMware helps with, server virtualization. They also that VMware deal only trails Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard and Dell's, Dell purchase as the biggest tech deals ever. It also agreed to buy this software vendor in 2018. For $19 billion. It had another acquisition of a security company for $10 billion in 2019. So Hock Tan does like going on these shopping sprees. He does like to acquire as a means to grow Broadcom. But Broadcom is a little bit different than Nvidia in the sense that Nvidia sells GPUs. Graphic processing units. Broadcom calls its version of GPUs exposed, which are just slightly different. They are a little bit more advanced. These chips aren't for just your everyday company. They are only for the companies that really want to push to the edge of, efficiency and power. 20, 30% faster, 20, 30% less power. So you have to be a Google. You have to be a matter. You have to be a Microsoft to actually find use in that. But luckily those companies are spending very, very big on AI. And so Broadcom is in a pretty solid position right now. They're spending $59 billion in the last quarter alone. That's four companies alphabet Amazon meta and Microsoft spent $59 billion on capital expenditures. A lot of that is going to Nvidia. A lot of that is going to Broadcom. That's about 18% of their total revenue over the quarter. So a very concentrated group of customers. You know you ever talk about having a you know a very specialized customer base. They have you know, 3 or 4 customers. So it really the fortunes depend on whether these companies continue to spend or they pull back. And now it is $1 trillion. That is pretty crazy because you definitely haven't heard of Broadcom unless you're pretty plugged into maybe the chip industry. But now it is literally part of that 13 figure club. The rumor mill is still buzzing about the drones flying over\n",

      "(Timestamp: 10:45) What is up with drones??\n",
      "Transcript:\n",
      "new Jersey with more questions and answers emerging over the weekend. To recap, new Jersey residents have been bewildered over the past few weeks due to drones buzzing over their state. A U.S. Army research facility has reported 11 confirmed instances of drones illegally entering its airspace, while more than a dozen drones have been spotted over a US naval weapons station since early December. sightings have also been reported in six counties across the state, prompting US lawmakers to get more involved. US Senator Chuck Schumer called on the Department of Homeland Security to deploy a recently declassified tech that can ID and track drones back to their landing spots in an effort to get to the bottom of the sightings. As for what we do know, officials from Homeland Security say that the drones don't appear to be linked to foreign governments. While the FBI is pretty sure a lot of people have just been seeing planes, quote, many of the reported drone sightings are in fact, manned aircraft being misidentified as drones, they said in a statement. Either way, Neal, we're now multiple weeks into these sightings, and still no one has really gotten to the bottom of things. No. They have they don't know what's going on. This really dominated the Sunday talk shows yesterday. Everyone was talking about, I know you were busy watching Manchester City, Manchester United, but there are tons of lawmakers going on these shows talking about the drone issue. It is certainly raised to the national level because it's not just new Jersey, it's also Connecticut, New York and Maryland as well. On Friday night, they had to shut down Stewart International Airport, about 60 miles north of New York City, in order to deal with a drone issue. So the question here is, are these benign? Like, what is going on? Are these planes are these actual is there actual a drone infestation? Senator Andy Kim, who's, from new Jersey, a senator for new Jersey, said he went out on local patrol with police in new Jersey and said that after going out with the police to observe reports of possible drones, the AI concluded that most of the drone sightings that were pointed out to me were almost certainly planes. That said, he criticized information delivery from federal officials, saying they weren't being transparent and that they should in their public communication, just compare this to a crisis CEO moment that you want to be as transparent as possible. Explain your reasoning, because right now the Pentagon and the FBI are saying, guys, it's not a big deal. They're everything's legal. They are planes. You're making all this up. That's just like, not a good community. Like a good, effective communication strategy. So senators and other law, state lawmakers are calling on the feds to say, okay, if there is nothing, explain how you found that out and let the people know, because they're getting a little frustrated and they're getting a little worried. One thing that could be contributing to this, though, is that even if a lot of the sightings are playing, some people could be actually seeing hobbyist drones because a 2023 FAA regulatory change did allow drones to be flown at night, which could possibly be behind some of the, increase in sightings. Plus U.S. law does really limit how the U.S. military can actually respond to drones. They're not allowed to just shoot them out of the air as they do need special authorization. They need to give special authorization to local authorities to deal with drones as well. And so maybe a combination of those two factors is leading to an increase in sightings. It could I mean, we could be talking about literally just a few pranksters or someone flying these drones around because they're allowed to at night, even though they aren't allowed to go into FAA restricted airspace. But still, maybe those are some of the factors that are contributing this as well. It's completely legal. Like they're there's 800,000 drone registrations now, which is the equivalent of the population of San Francisco. So there are a lot of drones flying around. You can fly them around at night. It's legal to fly a drone in most locations below 400ft. You don't really need anything else to send a drone up there. So, you know, there's they're like, there's nothing we can do. Like we can't shoot them down because we're not allowed to shoot down random drones that are flying legally because there's collateral damage over the local area and things like that. So, you know, we'll see what happens with this story. I think there is a push for more transparency from federal officials to just explain, just show their work, essentially. Up next, it is our winners of the weekend. Welcome to winners of the weekend, the segment where Toby and I picked two things that cemented their spot on Santa's nice list the past couple of days. I won the pre So I get to go first. My winner is anyone who hates changing the clocks twice a year, because now\n",

      "(Timestamp: 15:10) Trump wants to end Daylight Saving Time\n",
      "Transcript:\n",
      "you have the most powerful person in the world on your side. Friday night, President elect Trump wrote on Truth Social that he wants to end daylight saving time, calling it, quote, inconvenient and very costly to our nation. He said he'll work with Republicans to make standard time permanent when he takes office. Just as a refresher, the idea behind daylight saving time is to shift an hour of sunlight from the morning to the evening during the summer months, so that people can enjoy the daylight during their time off from work and spend money to juice the economy. It became federal law in 1966, so now every state besides Hawaii and Arizona spring their clocks forward in March and fall back after Halloween every year. Toby, this debate has been raging for decades, and even though Americans say they don't want to keep changing the clocks, there's been a little political appetite to change it. Maybe Trump getting on board will give it the juice it needs to get across the finish line. You can make a lot of arguments for either side of this. Whether you want to stay with standard time or move to permanent daylight saving time is one of them is consumer spending. Most people say that when people spend money after work, it's better to have more sunshine available because you would go to stores because it's still light out. That being said, online shopping is a lot of people do most of their shopping these days. So does it really matter if it's light or dark out? Another thing too, is that daylight Savings Time is supposed to make your electric bill cheaper, but there hasn't been really any agreement on whether it actually does lower energy use. And then finally, sleep and health is a big one as well. Standard time when it's lighter in the mornings does help your circadian rhythm, because getting that sunlight. Anyone who listens to, you know, the Andrew Huberman pod knows that daylight exposure to sunlight exposure is probably good for you, provides a better night's sleep because it gets you on the screen with rhythm. But also more sunlight in the evenings is probably good for your mental health as well, because no one likes it being dark when you when you leave work every day. So for every argument for one side of the equation, some people have another argument arguing for the opposite right? But permanent standard time is just better. Oh, so Neil clearly thinks I'm clearly on that side. More sunlight in the morning. But I want to talk about this discrepancy because Trump said that he wants permanent standard time, which you don't believe because you think he messed up, because Trump, because the general political consensus. There have been bills introduced in 2022 and 2023 by Marco Rubio, a Republican wanting permanent daylight saving time, because that is where you get the most. You maximize the evening sunlight, which seems to be a little more politically palatable, permanent standard time is the one of is what people like wonky. You know, the wonks want the sleep association, the medical health experts. That's they want permanent standard time. But in terms of, you know, what is more politically feasible? It's daylight saving time permanent. So you think that he maybe misspoke here and wants daylight saving time permanent? Yeah. When I think when he said he wants to end daylight saving, he means he wants to make daylight saving permanent because that is what he expressed support for back in 2019. He tweeted out support for permanent DST back in 2019. So I do think that by ending it, he just means we don't want to shift clocks anymore, pick one way or the other, right? And I think the way, based off his previous statements is he wants to make DST permanent. My win over the weekend is Hot Wheels because they are on fire right now.\n",

      "(Timestamp: 18:30) Hot Wheels lead the way\n",
      "Transcript:\n",
      "The 56 year old brand is the best selling toy in the world, according to the market research firm Circrna. With fans stretching from three year olds all the way up to 63 year olds. It's one of the stand out lines under the Mattel umbrella, going toe to toe the likes of Barbie, and saw its sales grow 14% to reach nearly $1.5 billion last year. At its current pace, Mattel sells 22.5 Hot Wheels cars per second, good for 791 million cars a year. You know, a lot of trends are taking Hot Wheels into high gear. One, they are cheap, but most starting at just one dollars and $0.25 apiece, too. Nostalgia is in right now, and these cars evoke warm feelings of childhood fun. And three there is a major collector scene with adults fanatics driving about one third of global revenue, according to the company. The only way I can describe it, Neil, is Hot Wheels is hot. They are hot. They are also licensing their IP, which you're seeing from Barbie and other toy brands, is a great way to maximize revenue. Of course, there's a Hot Wheels, movie coming on the heels of Barbie. Mattel is like, oh well, Barbie sales jumped 16% after it released the Barbie movie. You know, let's do that for Hot Wheels too. That's already growing at 14% a year. Why don't we do sales even more? I think, you know, I think they just have so many. We talked about Broadcom having a very narrow customer base. Hot wheels has literally everybody on the planet buying Hot Wheels for various different reasons. You have the kids that want it just for fun. You have the adults that are literally paying $99 a year for a subscription to get the latest collectible models. That is recurring revenue for a toy company. That's kind of unheard of. So this company is clicking on all cylinders, and it just goes back to maybe American's love affair with cars. It really does. I do think you can't overlook price either, because selling for a $1.25 a piece, that's a big draw in an inflationary environment, especially if you think if you actually do the math, the toys cost less today than they did in 1968. They retailed for about 69 to $0.89 back in the 60s and 70s. But that's roughly 6 to $8 in today's dollars. So it's one I want to know where are they making these? I know their level of craftsmanship cannot be right. There has been a little bit of pushback because people have shown the bottom of Hot Wheels cars and how over time, they've been a little simplified. Because you're right, they are producing a lot. But one of the things is, I mean, I mentioned that they're selling 22.5 Hot Wheels toys per second. They're also making 22.5 Hot Wheels toys per second. So that level of scale allows them to sell them for very cheaply. And maybe it's subsidized by this subscription plan that some people are talking about. One, fun story about this, the Mattel toy umbrella, whatever you want to call it. The connection between Barbie and Hot Wheels runs very deep because Hot Wheels creator Elliott Handler was married to the woman behind Barbie, Ruth Handler. If that isn't fate, or if that isn't just an aligning of these\n",

      "toy forces and I don't know what is, it's Monday, and as per tradition here are the events you need to know about for the week ahead. The fed is holding its final meeting of the year on Wednesday, and it's overwhelmingly expected to cut rates. A standard quarter percentage point, the third rate cut this year. Well, that's pretty much locked in. The big question mark is its rate path. In 2025. Inflation is proving to be more stubborn than anticipated, hovering above that 2% target. And Trump's economic policies like tariffs could complicate the picture even more. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg have a median estimate of three rate cuts. Next year, but we'll see what Jay Powell says. This might be the last meeting where we know what's going to happen, because there are just so many question marks on the horizon. Does inflation that just jump back up or are these tariffs going to be more of a bargaining chip if they do go into effect and jack up prices, that's when the situation becomes a little murky. Because how can you go ahead with rate cuts if you see inflation starting to creep back in. Probably camp baby. It's cold outside. And if you plan on hunkering down, there's plenty to watch on the screen, big and small, Mr. Beast Squid Game inspired a competition show beast games hits Amazon Prime Video on Thursday, offering a grand prize of $5 million. Mufasa, the prequel to 2019 live action Lion King, arrives in theaters on Friday. And then, if you want to impress your film major friends, go see Oscar contender The Brutal List starring Adrien Brody, also out on Friday. I don't know, I mean, the only one I'm interested in is the brutalist because The Lion King prequel I just haven't seen much buzz about. Even though 2019 Lion King grossed $1.7 billion worldwide, that is a gigantic number. I can't see this. It just doesn't seem like there's been much buzz about it. And then Squid Games, I can't believe, are still doing well. Mr. Beast. I know it's Mr. Beast, but still like it feels like Squid Games cultural relevance has passed. They did release another season and Squid Games on YouTube that what he recreated did do very well. But I don't know. It's hard for me to get excited. It's a two. It's a big, big deal for the creator economy, if you want to call it that. For Mr. Beast to move beyond YouTube to the streaming and TV realm. So we'll see how that goes out. I mean, I'm not gonna lie. Let's be honest. In sports, here's an awesome story. The University of Vermont will play in its first ever championship game in any sport tonight, when the Catamounts take on Marshall for the men's soccer title tonight. No disrespect to the Catamounts, but they eliminated my younger brother in his final collegiate game ever in the NCAA tournament, so I forever have a beef with them. So to see them doing well is a little bittersweet for me. But congrats to the Catamounts! That is an awesome achievement and I will be tuning in to watch that. Okay, that is all the time we have.
